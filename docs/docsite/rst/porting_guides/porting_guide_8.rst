  :local:
  :depth: 2


Ansible 8 is based on Ansible-core 2.15.


We suggest you read this page along with the `Ansible 8 Changelog <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/8/CHANGELOG-v8.rst>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.


Playbook
========

No notable changes


Command Line
============

* The return code of ``ansible-galaxy search`` is now 0 instead of 1 and the stdout is empty when results are empty to align with other ``ansible-galaxy`` commands.


Deprecated
==========

* Providing a list of dictionaries to ``vars:`` is deprecated in favor of supplying a dictionary.

  Instead of:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     vars:
       - var1: foo
       - var2: bar

  Use:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     vars:
       var1: foo
       var2: bar

Porting Guide for v8.0.0a3
==========================

Known Issues
------------

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The modules and plugins using the vendored code from Docker SDK for Python currently do not work with requests 2.29.0 and/or urllib3 2.0.0. The same is currently true for the latest version of Docker SDK for Python itself (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/611, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/612).

Breaking Changes
----------------

lowlydba.sqlserver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updating minimum DBATools version to v2.0.0 to allow for pwsh 7.3+ compatibility. There may also be breaking change behavior in DBATools, see https://blog.netnerds.net/2023/03/whats-new-dbatools-2.0/. (https://github.com/lowlydba/lowlydba.sqlserver/pull/181)

Deprecated Features
-------------------

community.crypto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- x509_crl - the ``mode`` option is deprecated; use ``crl_mode`` instead. The ``mode`` option will change its meaning in community.crypto 3.0.0, and will refer to the CRL file's mode instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/596).

Porting Guide for v8.0.0a2
==========================

Known Issues
------------

dellemc.openmanage

- idrac_redfish_storage_contoller - Issue(256164) - If incorrect value is provided for one of the attributes in the provided attribute list for controller configuration, then this module does not exit with error.
- idrac_user - Issue(192043) The module may error out with the message ``Unable to perform the import or export operation because there are pending attribute changes or a configuration job is in progress``. Wait for the job to complete and run the task again.
- ome_application_alerts_syslog - Issue(215374) - The module does not provide a proper error message if the destination_address is more than 255 characters.
- ome_device_network_services - Issue(212681) - The module does not provide a proper error message if unsupported values are provided for the following parameters- port_number, community_name, max_sessions, max_auth_retries, and idle_timeout.
- ome_device_power_settings - Issue(212679) - The module displays the following message if the value provided for the parameter ``power_cap`` is not within the supported range of 0 to 32767, ``Unable to complete the request because PowerCap does not exist or is not applicable for the resource URI.``
- ome_smart_fabric_uplink - Issue(186024) - Despite the module supported by OpenManage Enterprise Modular, it does not allow the creation of multiple uplinks of the same name. If an uplink is created using the same name as an existing uplink, the existing uplink is modified.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

check_point.mgmt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- add/set/delete nat-rule modules - will be replaced by the single cp_mgmt_nat_rule module.
- cp_mgmt_show_task/s modules - will be replaced by the by the single cp_mgmt_task_facts module.

cisco.ios
~~~~~~~~~

- ios_bgp_address_family - deprecate redistribute.ospf.match.type_1 with redistribute.ospf.match.nssa_externals.type_1
- ios_bgp_address_family - deprecate redistribute.ospf.match.type_2 with redistribute.ospf.match.nssa_externals.type_2

Porting Guide for v8.0.0a1
==========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- dellemc.powerflex (version 1.6.0)
- dellemc.unity (version 1.6.0)
- grafana.grafana (version 2.0.0)
- microsoft.ad (version 1.0.0)
- servicenow.servicenow (version 1.0.6)

Known Issues
------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-test - Additional configuration may be required for certain container host and container combinations. Further details are available in the testing documentation.
- ansible-test - Custom containers with ``VOLUME`` instructions may be unable to start, when previously the containers started correctly. Remove the ``VOLUME`` instructions to resolve the issue. Containers with this condition will cause ``ansible-test`` to emit a warning.
- ansible-test - Systems with Podman networking issues may be unable to run containers, when previously the issue went unreported. Correct the networking issues to continue using ``ansible-test`` with Podman.
- ansible-test - Unit tests for collections do not support ``pytest`` assertion rewriting on Python 2.7.
- ansible-test - Using Docker on systems with SELinux may require setting SELinux to permissive mode. Podman should work with SELinux in enforcing mode.
- dnf5 - The DNF5 package manager currently does not provide all functionality to ensure feature parity between the existing ``dnf`` and the new ``dnf5`` module. As a result the following ``dnf5`` options are effectively a no-op: ``cacheonly``, ``enable_plugin``, ``disable_plugin`` and ``lock_timeout``.

cisco.meraki
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- meraki_network - Updated documentation for `local_status_page_enabled` and `remote_status_page_enabled` as these no longer work.

community.routeros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- api_modify - when limits for entries in ``queue tree`` are defined as human readable - for example ``25M`` -, the configuration will be correctly set in ROS, but the module will indicate the item is changed on every run even when there was no change done. This is caused by the ROS API which returns the number in bytes - for example ``25000000`` (which is inconsistent with the CLI behavior). In order to mitigate that, the limits have to be defined in bytes (those will still appear as human readable in the ROS CLI) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/131).
- api_modify, api_info - ``routing ospf area``, ``routing ospf area range``, ``routing ospf instance``, ``routing ospf interface-template`` paths are not fully implemeted for ROS6 due to the significat changes between ROS6 and ROS7 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/131).

dellemc.openmanage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- idrac_firmware - Issue(249879) - Firmware update of iDRAC9-based Servers fails if SOCKS proxy with authentication is used.
- idrac_os_deployment- Issue(260496) - OS installation will support only NFS and CIFS share to store the custom ISO in the destination_path, HTTP/HTTPS/FTP not supported
- idrac_redfish_storage_contoller - Issue(256164) - If incorrect value is provided for one of the attributes in the provided attribute list for controller configuration, then this module does not exit with error.
- idrac_user - Issue(192043) The module may error out with the message ``Unable to perform the import or export operation because there are pending attribute changes or a configuration job is in progress``. Wait for the job to complete and run the task again.
- idrac_user - Issue(192043) The module may error out with the message ``unable to perform the import or export operation because there are pending attribute changes or a configuration job is in progress``. Wait for the job to complete and run the task again.
- ome_application_alerts_syslog - Issue(215374) - The module does not provide a proper error message if the destination_address is more than 255 characters.
- ome_device_network_services - Issue(212681) - The module does not provide a proper error message if unsupported values are provided for the following parameters- port_number, community_name, max_sessions, max_auth_retries, and idle_timeout.
- ome_device_network_services - Issue(212681) - The module does not provide a proper error message if unsupported values are provided for the parameters- port_number, community_name, max_sessions, max_auth_retries, and idle_timeout.
- ome_device_power_settings - Issue(212679) - The module displays the following message if the value provided for the parameter ``power_cap`` is not within the supported range of 0 to 32767, ``Unable to complete the request because PowerCap does not exist or is not applicable for the resource URI.``
- ome_inventory - Issue(256257) - All hosts are not retrieved for ``Modular System`` group and corresponding child groups.
- ome_inventory - Issue(256589) - All hosts are not retrieved for ``Custom Groups`` group and corresponding child groups.
- ome_inventory - Issue(256593) - All hosts are not retrieved for ``PLUGIN GROUPS`` group and corresponding child groups.
- ome_smart_fabric_uplink - Issue(186024) - Despite the module supported by OpenManage Enterprise Modular, it does not allow the creation of multiple uplinks of the same name. If an uplink is created using the same name as an existing uplink, the existing uplink is modified.
- ome_smart_fabric_uplink - Issue(186024) - The module does not allow the creation of multiple uplinks of the same name even though it is supported by OpenManage Enterprise Modular. If an uplink is created using the same name as an existing uplink, the existing uplink is modified.

Breaking Changes
----------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-doc - no longer treat plugins in collections whose name starts with ``_`` as deprecated (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79362).
- ansible-test - Integration tests which depend on specific file permissions when running in an ansible-test managed host environment may require changes. Tests that require permissions other than ``755`` or ``644`` may need to be updated to set the necessary permissions as part of the test run.
- ansible-test - The ``vcenter`` test plugin now defaults to using a user-provided static configuration instead of the ``govcsim`` simulator for collections. Set the ``ANSIBLE_VCSIM_CONTAINER`` environment variable to ``govcsim`` to use the simulator. Keep in mind that the simulator is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- ansible-test sanity - previously plugins and modules in collections whose name started with ``_`` were treated as deprecated, even when they were not marked as deprecated in ``meta/runtime.yml``. This is no longer the case (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79362).
- ansible-test validate-modules - Removed the ``missing-python-doc`` error code in validate modules, ``missing-documentation`` is used instead for missing PowerShell module documentation.

ansible.netcommon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- NetworkConnectionBase now inherits from PersistentConnectionBase in ansible.utils. As a result, the minimum ansible.utils version has increased to 2.7.0.
- NetworkTemplate is no longer importable from ansible_collections.ansible.netcommon.plugins.module_utils.network.common and should now be found at its proper location ansible_collections.ansible.netcommon.plugins.module_utils.network.common.rm_base.network_template
- ResourceModule is no longer importable from ansible_collections.ansible.netcommon.plugins.module_utils.network.common and should now be found at its proper location ansible_collections.ansible.netcommon.plugins.module_utils.network.common.rm_base.resource_module
- VALID_MASKS, is_masklen, is_netmask, to_bits, to_ipv6_network, to_masklen, to_netmask, and to_subnet are no longer importable from ansible_collections.ansible.netcommon.plugins.module_utils.network.common.utils and should now be found at their proper location ansible.module_utils.common.network

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ModuleHelper module utils - when the module sets output variables named ``msg``, ``exception``, ``output``, ``vars``, or ``changed``, the actual output will prefix those names with ``_`` (underscore symbol) only when they clash with output variables generated by ModuleHelper itself, which only occurs when handling exceptions. Please note that this breaking change does not require a new major release since before this release, it was not possible to add such variables to the output `due to a bug <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5755>`__ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5765).

hetzner.hcloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- inventory plugin - Python v3.5+ is now required.

Major Changes
-------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-test - Docker Desktop on WSL2 is now supported (additional configuration required).
- ansible-test - Docker and Podman are now supported on hosts with cgroup v2 unified. Previously only cgroup v1 and cgroup v2 hybrid were supported.
- ansible-test - Podman now works on container hosts without systemd. Previously only some containers worked, while others required rootfull or rootless Podman, but would not work with both. Some containers did not work at all.
- ansible-test - Podman on WSL2 is now supported.
- ansible-test - When additional cgroup setup is required on the container host, this will be automatically detected. Instructions on how to configure the host will be provided in the error message shown.

- consul - deprecate using parameters unused for ``state=absent`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5772).
- gitlab_runner - the default of the new option ``access_level_on_creation`` will change from ``false`` to ``true`` in community.general 7.0.0. This will cause ``access_level`` to be used during runner registration as well, and not only during updates (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5908).
- gitlab_runner - the option ``access_level`` will lose its default value in community.general 8.0.0. From that version on, you have set this option to ``ref_protected`` explicitly, if you want to have a protected runner (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/5925).
