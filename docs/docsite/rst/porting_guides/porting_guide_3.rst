Ansible 3 Porting Guide
=======================

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 2


Ansible 3 is based on Ansible-Base 2.10, which is the same major release as Ansible 2.10.  Therefore, there is no section on ansible-base in this porting guide.  If you are upgrading from Ansible 2.9, please first consult the Ansible 2.10 porting guide before continuing with the Ansible 3 porting guide.

We suggest you read this page along with the `Ansible 3 Changelog <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/3/CHANGELOG-v3.rst>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.

Porting Guide for v3.2.0
========================

Known Issues
------------

dellemc.openmanage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- idrac_user - Issue(192043) Module may error out with the message ``unable to perform the import or export operation because there are pending attribute changes or a configuration job is in progress``. Wait for the job to complete and run the task again.
- ome_configuration_compliance_info - Issue(195592) Module may error out with the message ``unable to process the request because an error occurred``. If the issue persists, report it to the system administrator.
- ome_smart_fabric - Issue(185322) Only three design types are supported by OpenManage Enterprise Modular but the module successfully creates a fabric when the design type is not supported.
- ome_smart_fabric_uplink - Issue(186024) ome_smart_fabric_uplink module does not allow the creation of multiple uplinks of the same name even though this is supported by OpenManage Enterprise Modular. If an uplink is created using the same name as an existing uplink, the existing uplink is modified.

Breaking Changes
----------------

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- docker_swarm - if ``join_token`` is specified, a returned join token with the same value will be replaced by ``VALUE_SPECIFIED_IN_NO_LOG_PARAMETER``. Make sure that you do not blindly use the join tokens from the return value of this module when the module is invoked with ``join_token`` specified! This breaking change appears in a minor release since it is necessary to fix a security issue (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/103).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

community.crypto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- acme module_utils - the ``acme`` module_utils (``ansible_collections.community.crypto.plugins.module_utils.acme``) is deprecated and will be removed in community.crypto 2.0.0. Use the new Python modules in the ``acme`` package instead (``ansible_collections.community.crypto.plugins.module_utils.acme.xxx``) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).

An incorrect message is displayed in the task output as 'DRAC WSMAN endpoint returned HTTP code '400' Reason 'Bad Request''. This issue may occur if the target iDRAC firmware version is less than 3.30.30.30

Breaking Changes
----------------

Ansible-base
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-galaxy login command has been removed (see https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71560)

ansible.utils
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If added custom sub plugins in your collection move from old location `plugins/<sub-plugin-name>` to the new location `plugins/sub_plugins/<sub-plugin-name>` and update the imports as required
- Move sub plugins cli_parsers, fact_diff and validate to `plugins/sub_plugins` folder
- The `cli_parsers` sub plugins folder name is changed to `cli_parse` to have consistent naming convention, that is all the cli_parse subplugins will now be in `plugins/sub_plugins/cli_parse` folder

cloudscale_ch.cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- floating_ip - ``name`` is required for assigning a new floating IP.

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If you use Ansible 2.9 and the Google cloud plugins or modules from this collection, community.general 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the Google cloud content by FQCN, like ``community.general.gce_img``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``community.google.gce_img`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``community.google`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.general manually, you need to make sure to also install the ``community.google`` or ``google.cloud`` collections if you are using any of the Google cloud plugins or modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.general 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (such as community.google) must be installed for them to work.

  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.general 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (community.hashi_vault) must be installed for them to work.
- If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``hetzner`` modules from this collections, community.general 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the hetzner content by FQCN, like ``community.general.hetzner_firewall``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``community.hrobot.firewall`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``community.hrobot`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.general manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.hrobot`` if you are using any of the ``hetzner`` modules.

  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``community.postgresql.postgresql_info`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``community.postgresql`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.general manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.postgresql`` if you are using any of the ``postgresql`` modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.general 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (community.postgresql) must be installed for them to work.
- The Google cloud inventory script ``gce.py`` has been migrated to the ``community.google`` collection. Install the ``community.google`` collection in order to continue using it.
- archive - remove path folder itself when ``remove`` parameter is true (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/1041).
- log_plays callback - add missing information to the logs generated by the callback plugin. This changes the log message format (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/442).
- passwordstore lookup plugin - now parsing a password store entry as YAML if possible, skipping the first line (which by convention only contains the password and nothing else). If it cannot be parsed as YAML, the old ``key: value`` parser will be used to process the entry. Can break backwards compatibility if YAML formatted code was parsed in a non-YAML interpreted way, e.g. ``foo: [bar, baz]`` will become a list with two elements in the new version, but a string ``'[bar, baz]'`` in the old (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/1673).
- pkgng - passing ``name: *`` with ``state: absent`` will no longer remove every installed package from the system. It is now a noop. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/569).
- pkgng - passing ``name: *`` with ``state: latest`` or ``state: present`` will no longer install every package from the configured package repositories. Instead, ``name: *, state: latest`` will upgrade all already-installed packages, and ``name: *, state: present`` is a noop. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/569).
- proxmox_kvm - recognize ``force=yes`` in conjunction with ``state=absent`` to forcibly remove a running VM (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/849).
- utm_proxy_auth_profile - the ``frontend_cookie_secret`` return value now contains a placeholder string instead of the module's ``frontend_cookie_secret`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1736).

community.hashi_vault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- hashi_vault - the ``VAULT_ADDR`` environment variable is now checked last for the ``url`` parameter. For details on which use cases are impacted, see (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/8).

community.hrobot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- firewall - now requires the `ipaddress <https://pypi.org/project/ipaddress/>`_ library (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/2).

community.network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If you use Ansible 2.9 and the FortiOS modules from this collection, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the FortiOS content by FQCN, like ``community.network.fmgr_device``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``community.fortios.fmgr_device`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``community.fortios`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.fortios`` if you are using any of the FortiOS modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (community.fortios) must be installed for them to work.
- If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``cp_publish`` module from this collection, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the module by FQCN, i.e. ``community.network.cp_publish``. Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``check_point.mgmt.cp_mgmt_publish``) and to make sure that you have ``check_point.mgmt`` installed.
  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``check_point.mgmt`` if you are using the ``cp_publish`` module. While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (check_point.mgmt) must be installed for them to work.
- If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``fortimanager`` httpapi plugin from this collection, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use it by FQCN (``community.network.fortimanager``).
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCN ``fortinet.fortimanager.fortimanager`` and to make sure that you have ``fortinet.fortimanager`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``fortinet.fortimanager`` if you are using the ``fortimanager`` httpapi plugin.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirect that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (fortinet.fortimanager) must be installed for it to work.
- If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``nso`` modules from this collection, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the nso content by FQCN, like ``community.network.nso_config``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``cisco.nso.nso_config`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``cisco.nso`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``cisco.nso`` if you are using any of the ``nso`` modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (cisco.nso) must be installed for them to work.
- If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``routeros`` plugins or modules from this collections, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the routeros content by FQCN, like ``community.network.routeros_command``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``community.routeros.command`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``community.routeros`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.routeros`` if you are using any of the ``routeros`` plugins or modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (community.routeros) must be installed for them to work.
- cnos_static_route - move ipaddress import from ansible.netcommon to builtin or package before ipaddress is removed from ansible.netcommon. You need to make sure to have the ipaddress package installed if you are using this module on Python 2.7 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/129).

dellemc.os10
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- os10_bgp - Changed "subnet"  key as list format instead of dictionary format under "listen" key to support multiple neighbor prefix for listen command
- os10_bgp - Changed "vrf" key as list format instead of dictionary format to supprot multiple VRF in router BGP and changed the "vrf" key name to "vrfs"

ngine_io.cloudstack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Authentication option using INI files e.g. ``cloudstack.ini`` has been removed. The only supported option to authenticate is by using the module params with fallback to the ENV variables.
- default zone deprecation - The `zone` param default value, across multiple modules, has been deprecated due to unreliable API (https://github.com/ngine-io/ansible-collection-cloudstack/pull/62).

Major Changes
-------------

cisco.aci
~~~~~~~~~

- Change certificate_name to name in aci_aaa_user_certificate module for query operation

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- For community.general 3.0.0, the ``ome_device_info``, ``idrac_firmware`` and ``idrac_server_config_profile`` modules will be moved to the `dellemc.openmanage <https://galaxy.ansible.com/dellemc/openmanage>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use the DellEMC modules mentioned above from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``dellemc.openmanage.`` instead of ``community.general.``,
  for example replace ``community.general.ome_device_info`` in a task by ``dellemc.openmanage.ome_device_info``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.general`` manually and rely on the DellEMC modules mentioned above, you have to make sure to install the ``dellemc.openmanage`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, for example ``community.general.ome_device_info`` instead of ``ome_device_info``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.
- The community.general collection no longer depends on the ansible.netcommon collection (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1561).
- The community.general collection no longer depends on the ansible.posix collection (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1157).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed arp_state parameter from the bigip_virtual_address module

Deprecated Features
-------------------

cisco.nxos
~~~~~~~~~~

- Deprecated `nxos_bgp` and `nxos_bgp_neighbor` modules in favor of `nxos_bgp_global` resource module.
- Deprecated `nxos_interface_ospf` in favor of `nxos_ospf_interfaces` Resource Module.
- Deprecated `nxos_smu` in favour of `nxos_rpm` module.
- The `nxos_ospf_vrf` module is deprecated by `nxos_ospfv2` and `nxos_ospfv3` Resource Modules.

community.aws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ec2_vpc_igw_info - After 2022-06-22 the ``convert_tags`` parameter default value will change from ``False`` to ``True`` to match the collection standard behavior (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/318).

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- docker_container - currently ``published_ports`` can contain port mappings next to the special value ``all``, in which case the port mappings are ignored. This behavior is deprecated for community.docker 2.0.0, at which point it will either be forbidden, or this behavior will be properly implemented similar to how the Docker CLI tool handles this (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/8, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/60).

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``gluster_heal_info``, ``gluster_peer`` and ``gluster_volume`` modules have migrated to the `gluster.gluster <https://galaxy.ansible.com/gluster/gluster>`_ collection. Ansible-base 2.10.1 adjusted the routing target to point to the modules in that collection, so we will remove these modules in community.general 3.0.0. If you use Ansible 2.9, or use FQCNs ``community.general.gluster_*`` in your playbooks and/or roles, please update them to use the modules from ``gluster.gluster`` instead.
- The ldap_attr module has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release; use ldap_attrs instead.
