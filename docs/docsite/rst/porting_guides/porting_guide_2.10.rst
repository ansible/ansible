==========================
Ansible 2.10 Porting Guide
==========================

.. warning::

         In preparation for the release of 2.10, many plugins and modules have migrated to Collections on  `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com>`_. For the current development status of Collections and FAQ see `Ansible Collections Community Guide <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/README.rst>`_. We expect the 2.10 Porting Guide to change frequently up to the 2.10 release. Follow the conversations about collections on our various :ref:`communication` channels for the latest information on the status of the ``devel`` branch.

This section discusses the behavioral changes between Ansible 2.9 and Ansible 2.10.

It is intended to assist in updating your playbooks, plugins and other parts of your Ansible infrastructure so they will work with this version of Ansible.

We suggest you read this page along with the `Ansible Changelog for 2.10 <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/2.10/CHANGELOG-v2.10.rst>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.

Since 2.10, ansible consists of two parts:
* ansible-base, which are the ansible command line tools with a very small selection of plugins and modules, and
* a `set of collections <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/2.10/ansible.in>`_.

The :ref:`porting_2.10_guide_base` is included in this porting guide. The complete list of porting guides can be found at :ref:`porting guides <porting_guides>`.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 2


Playbook
========

* Fixed a bug on boolean keywords that made random strings return 'False', now they should return an error if they are not a proper boolean
  Example: ``diff: yes-`` was returning ``False``.
* A new fact, ``ansible_processor_nproc`` reflects the number of vcpus
  available to processes (falls back to the number of vcpus available to
  the scheduler).


Command Line
============

No notable changes


Deprecated
==========

* Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 will no longer be supported or tested in the next Ansible release, see :ref:`windows_faq_server2008`.


Modules
=======

.. warning::

	Links on this page may not point to the most recent versions of modules. We will update them when we can.

* Version 2.10.0 of ansible-base changed the default mode of file-based tasks to ``0o600 & ~umask`` when the user did not specify a ``mode`` parameter on file-based tasks. This was in response to a CVE report which we have reconsidered. As a result, the mode change has been reverted in 2.10.1, and mode will now default to ``0o666 & ~umask`` as in previous versions of Ansible.
* If you changed any tasks to specify less restrictive permissions while using 2.10.0, those changes will be unnecessary (but will do no harm) in 2.10.1.
* To avoid the issue raised in CVE-2020-1736, specify a ``mode`` parameter in all file-based tasks that accept it.


Noteworthy module changes
-------------------------

* Ansible modules created with ``add_file_common_args=True`` added a number of undocumented arguments which were mostly there to ease implementing certain action plugins. The undocumented arguments ``src``, ``follow``, ``force``, ``content``, ``backup``, ``remote_src``, ``regexp``, ``delimiter``, and ``directory_mode`` are now no longer added. Modules relying on these options to be added need to specify them by themselves.
* Ansible no longer looks for Python modules in the current working directory (typically the ``remote_user``'s home directory) when an Ansible module is run. This is to fix becoming an unprivileged user on OpenBSD and to mitigate any attack vector if the current working directory is writable by a malicious user. Install any Python modules needed to run the Ansible modules on the managed node in a system-wide location or in another directory which is in the ``remote_user``'s ``$PYTHONPATH`` and readable by the ``become_user``.


Plugins
=======

Lookup plugin names case-sensitivity
------------------------------------

* Prior to Ansible ``2.10`` lookup plugin names passed in as an argument to the ``lookup()`` function were treated as case-insensitive as opposed to lookups invoked via ``with_<lookup_name>``. ``2.10`` brings consistency to ``lookup()`` and ``with_`` to be both case-sensitive.

Noteworthy plugin changes
-------------------------

* Cache plugins in collections can be used to cache data from inventory plugins. Previously, cache plugins in collections could only be used for fact caching.
* Some undocumented arguments from ``FILE_COMMON_ARGUMENTS`` have been removed; plugins using these, in particular action plugins, need to be adjusted. The undocumented arguments which were removed are ``src``, ``follow``, ``force``, ``content``, ``backup``, ``remote_src``, ``regexp``, ``delimiter``, and ``directory_mode``.

Action plugins which execute modules should use fully-qualified module names
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Action plugins that call modules should pass explicit, fully-qualified module names to ``_execute_module()`` whenever possible (eg, ``ansible.builtin.file`` rather than ``file``). This ensures that the task's collection search order is not consulted to resolve the module. Otherwise, a module from a collection earlier in the search path could be used when not intended.

Porting custom scripts
======================

No notable changes

Porting Guide for v2.10.0b1
===========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

ansible.windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- win_find - module has been refactored to better match the behaviour of the ``find`` module. Here is what has changed:
    * When the directory specified by ``paths`` does not exist or is a file, it will no longer fail and will just warn the user
    * Junction points are no longer reported as ``islnk``, use ``isjunction`` to properly report these files. This behaviour matches the win_stat module
    * Directories no longer return a ``size``, this matches the ``stat`` and ``find`` behaviour and has been removed due to the difficulties in correctly reporting the size of a directory
- win_user - Change idempotency checks for ``description`` to be case sensitive
- win_user - Change idempotency checks for ``fullname`` to be case sensitive

Porting Guide for v2.10.0a8
===========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- pkgng - passing ``name: *`` with ``state: latest`` or ``state: present`` will no longer install every package from the configured package repositories. Instead, ``name: *, state: latest`` will upgrade all already-installed packages, and ``name: *, state: present`` is a noop. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/569).

community.vmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- vmware_datastore_maintenancemode - now returns ``datastore_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
- vmware_guest_custom_attributes - does not require VM name which was a required parameter for releases prior to Ansible 2.10.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- vmware_portgroup - removed 'inbound_policy', and 'rolling_order' deprecated options.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ldap_attr module has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release; use ldap_attrs instead.

community.vmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The vmware_dns_config module has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release; use vmware_host_dns instead.
- vca - vca_fw, vca_nat, vca_app are deprecated since these modules rely on deprecated part of Pyvcloud library.

Porting Guide for v2.10.0a7
===========================

Major Changes
-------------

Porting Guide for v2.10.0a5
===========================

Removed Collections
-------------------

- dellemc_networking.os10 (previously included version: 1.0.2)

Porting Guide for v2.10.0a4
===========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

ansible.windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- setup - Make sure ``ansible_date_time.epoch`` is seconds since EPOCH in UTC to mirror the POSIX facts. The ``ansible_date_time.epoch_local`` contains seconds since EPOCH in the local timezone for backwards compatibility
- setup - Will now add the IPv6 scope on link local addresses for ``ansible_ip_addresses``
- setup - ``ansible_processor`` will now return the index before the other values to match the POSIX fact behaviour
- win_find - No longer filters by size on directories, this feature had a lot of bugs, slowed down the module, and not a supported scenario with the ``find`` module.

Removed Features
----------------

community.windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- win_disk_image - removed the deprecated return value ``mount_path`` in favour of ``mount_paths``.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

ansible.windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- win_domain_computer - Deprecated the undocumented ``log_path`` option. This option will be removed in a major release after ``2022-07-01``.
- win_regedit - Deprecated using forward slashes as a path separator, use backslashes to avoid ambiguity between a forward slash in the key name or a forward slash as a path separator. This feature will be removed in a major release after ``2021-07-01``.

Porting Guide for v2.10.0a3
===========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

netbox.netbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- To pass in integers via Ansible Jinja filters for a key in ``data`` that
  requires querying an endpoint is now done by making it a dictionary with
  an ``id`` key. The previous behavior was to just pass in an integer and
  it was converted when normalizing the data, but some people may have names
  that are all integers and those were being converted erroneously so we made
  the decision to change the method to convert to an integer for the NetBox
  API.

  ::

    tasks:
      - name: Create device within NetBox with only required information
        netbox_device:
          netbox_url: http://netbox-demo.org:32768
          netbox_token: 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
          data:
            name: Test66
            device_type:
              id: "{{ some_jinja_variable }}"
            device_role: Core Switch
            site: Test Site
            status: Staged
          state: present
- ``pynetbox`` changed to using ``requests.Session()`` to manage the HTTP session
  which broke passing in ``ssl_verify`` when building the NetBox API client.
  This PR makes ``pynetbox 5.0.4+`` the new required version of `pynetbox` for
  the Ansible modules and lookup plugin. (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/269)

Porting Guide for v2.10.0a2
===========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The environment variable for the auth context for the oc.py connection plugin has been corrected (K8S_CONTEXT).  It was using an initial lowercase k by mistake. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/377).
- bigpanda - the parameter ``message`` was renamed to ``deployment_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
- cisco_spark - the module option ``message`` was renamed to ``msg``, as ``message`` is used internally in Ansible Core engine (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/39295)
- datadog - the parameter ``message`` was renamed to ``notification_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
- docker_container - no longer passes information on non-anonymous volumes or binds as ``Volumes`` to the Docker daemon. This increases compatibility with the ``docker`` CLI program. Note that if you specify ``volumes: strict`` in ``comparisons``, this could cause existing containers created with docker_container from Ansible 2.9 or earlier to restart.
- docker_container - support for port ranges was adjusted to be more compatible to the ``docker`` command line utility: a one-port container range combined with a multiple-port host range will no longer result in only the first host port be used, but the whole range being passed to Docker so that a free port in that range will be used.
- hashi_vault lookup - now returns the latest version when using the KV v2 secrets engine. Previously, it returned all versions of the secret which required additional steps to extract and filter the desired version.

community.network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- routeros_facts - allow multiple addresses and neighbors per interface. This makes ``ansible_net_neighbors`` a list instead of a dict (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/6).

theforeman.foreman
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- All modules were renamed to drop the ``foreman_`` and ``katello_`` prefixes.
  Additionally to the prefix removal, the following modules were further ranamed:

  * katello_upload to content_upload
  * katello_sync to repository_sync
  * katello_manifest to subscription_manifest
  * foreman_search_facts to resource_info
  * foreman_ptable to partition_table
  * foreman_model to hardware_model
  * foreman_environment to puppet_environment

Major Changes
-------------

Ansible-base
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Both ansible-doc and ansible-console's help command will error for modules and plugins whose return documentation cannot be parsed as YAML. All modules and plugins passing ``ansible-test sanity --test yamllint`` will not be affected by this.
- Collections may declare a list of supported/tested Ansible versions for the collection. A warning is issued if a collection does not support the Ansible version that loads it (can also be configured as silent or a fatal error). Collections that do not declare supported Ansible versions do not issue a warning/error.
- Plugin routing allows collections to declare deprecation, redirection targets, and removals for all plugin types.
- Plugins that import module_utils and other ansible namespaces that have moved to collections should continue to work unmodified.
- Routing data built into Ansible 2.10 ensures that 2.9 content should work unmodified on 2.10. Formerly included modules and plugins that were moved to collections are still accessible by their original unqualified names, so long as their destination collections are installed.
- When deprecations are done in code, they to specify a ``collection_name`` so that deprecation warnings can mention which collection - or ansible-base - is deprecating a feature. This affects all ``Display.deprecated()`` or ``AnsibleModule.deprecate()`` or ``Ansible.Basic.Deprecate()`` calls, and ``removed_in_version``/``removed_at_date`` or ``deprecated_aliases`` in module argument specs.
- ansible-test now uses a different ``default`` test container for Ansible Collections

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- docker_container - the ``network_mode`` option will be set by default to the name of the first network in ``networks`` if at least one network is given and ``networks_cli_compatible`` is ``true`` (will be default from community.general 2.0.0 on). Set to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings if you specify networks and set ``networks_cli_compatible`` to ``true``. The current default (not specifying it) is equivalent to the value ``default``.
- docker_container - the module has a new option, ``container_default_behavior``, whose default value will change from ``compatibility`` to ``no_defaults``. Set to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings.
- gitlab_user - no longer requires ``name``, ``email`` and ``password`` arguments when ``state=absent``.

Porting Guide for v2.10.0a1
===========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- cisco.nxos.nxos_igmp_interface - no longer supports the deprecated ``oif_prefix`` and ``oif_source`` options. These have been superceeded by ``oif_ps``.
- community.grafana.grafana_dashboard - the parameter ``message`` is renamed to ``commit_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
- purestorage.flashblade.purefb_fs - no longer supports the deprecated ``nfs`` option. This has been superceeded by ``nfsv3``.

netbox.netbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Change ``ip-addresses`` key in netbox inventory plugin to ``ip_addresses`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/139)
- Changed ``group`` to ``tenant_group`` in ``netbox_tenant.py`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/9)
- Changed ``role`` to ``prefix_role`` in ``netbox_prefix.py`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/9)
- Module failures when required fields arent provided (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/24)
- Renamed ``netbox_interface`` to ``netbox_device_interface`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/9)
- This version has a few breaking changes due to new namespace and collection name. I felt it necessary to change the name of the lookup plugin and inventory plugin just not to have a non descriptive namespace call to use them. Below is an example:
  ``netbox.netbox.netbox`` would be used for both inventory plugin and lookup plugin, but in different contexts so no collision will arise, but confusion will.
  I renamed the lookup plugin to ``nb_lookup`` so it will be used with the FQCN ``netbox.netbox.nb_lookup``.
  The inventory plugin will now be called within an inventory file by ``netbox.netbox.nb_inventory``
