Ansible 2.10 Porting Guide
==========================

.. warning::

         In preparation for the release of 2.10, many plugins and modules have migrated to Collections on  `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com>`_. For the current development status of Collections and FAQ see `Ansible Collections Community Guide <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/master/README.rst>`_. We expect the 2.10 Porting Guide to change frequently up to the 2.10 release. Follow the conversations about collections on our various :ref:`communication` channels for the latest information on the status of the ``devel`` branch.

This section discusses the behavioral changes between Ansible 2.9 and Ansible 2.10.

It is intended to assist in updating your playbooks, plugins and other parts of your Ansible infrastructure so they will work with this version of Ansible.

We suggest you read this page along with the `Ansible Changelog for 2.10 <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/2.10/CHANGELOG-v2.10.rst>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.

Since 2.10, ansible consists of two parts:
* ansible-base, which are the ansible command line tools with a very small selection of plugins and modules, and
* a `set of collections <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/2.10/ansible.in>`_.

The :ref:`porting_2.10_guide_base` is included in this porting guide. The complete list of porting guides can be found at :ref:`porting guides <porting_guides>`.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 2


Playbook
========

* Fixed a bug on boolean keywords that made random strings return 'False', now they should return an error if they are not a proper boolean
  Example: `diff: yes-` was returning `False`.
* A new fact, ``ansible_processor_nproc`` reflects the number of vcpus
  available to processes (falls back to the number of vcpus available to
  the scheduler).


Command Line
============

No notable changes


Deprecated
==========

* Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 will no longer be supported or tested in the next Ansible release, see :ref:`windows_faq_server2008`.


Modules
=======

Change to Default File Permissions
----------------------------------

To address CVE-2020-1736, the default permissions for certain files created by Ansible using ``atomic_move()`` were changed from ``0o666`` to ``0o600``. The default permissions value was only used for the temporary file before it was moved into its place or newly created files. If the file existed when the new temporary file was moved into place, Ansible would use the permissions of the existing file. If there was no existing file, Ansible would retain the default file permissions, combined with the system ``umask``, of the temporary file.

Most modules that call ``atomic_move()`` also call ``set_fs_attributes_if_different()`` or ``set_mode_if_different()``, which will set the permissions of the file to what is specified in the task.

A new warning will be displayed when all of the following conditions are true:

    - The file at the final destination, not the temporary file, does not exist
    - A module supports setting ``mode`` but it was not specified for the task
    - The module calls ``atomic_move()`` but does not later call ``set_fs_attributes_if_different()`` or ``set_mode_if_different()`` with a ``mode`` specified

The following modules call ``atomic_move()`` but do not call ``set_fs_attributes_if_different()``  or ``set_mode_if_different()`` and do not support setting ``mode``. This means for files they create, the default permissions have changed and there is no indication:

    - M(known_hosts)
    - M(service)


Code Audit
~~~~~~~~~~

The code was audited for modules that use ``atomic_move()`` but **do not** later call ``set_fs_attributes_if_different()`` or ``set_mode_if_different()``. Modules that provide no means for specifying the ``mode`` will not display a warning message since there is no way for the playbook author to remove the warning. The behavior of each module with regards to the default permissions of temporary files and the permissions of newly created files is explained below.

known_hosts
^^^^^^^^^^^

The M(known_hosts) module uses ``atomic_move()`` to operate on the ``known_hosts`` file specified by the ``path`` parameter in the module. It creates a temporary file using ``tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()`` which creates a temporary file that is readable and writable only by the creating user ID.

service
^^^^^^^

The M(service) module uses ``atomic_move()`` to operate on the default rc file, which is the first found of ``/etc/rc.conf``,  ``/etc/rc.conf.local``, and ``/usr/local/etc/rc.conf``. Since these files almost always exist on the target system, they will not be created and the existing permissions of the file will be used.

**The following modules were included in Ansible <= 2.9. They have moved to collections but are documented here for completeness.**

authorized_key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The M(authorized_key) module uses ``atomic_move()`` to operate on the the ``authorized_key`` file. A temporary file is created with ``tempfile.mkstemp()`` before being moved into place. The temporary file is readable and writable only by the creating user ID. The M(authorized_key) module manages the permissions of the the ``.ssh`` direcotry and ``authorized_keys`` files if ``managed_dirs`` is set to ``True``, which is the default. The module sets the ``ssh`` directory owner and group to the ``uid`` and ``gid`` of the user specified in the ``user`` parameter and directory permissions to ``700``. The module sets the ``authorized_key`` file owner and group to the ``uid`` and ``gid`` of the user specified in the ``user`` parameter and file permissions to ``600``. These values cannot be controlled by module parameters.

interfaces_file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The M(interfaces_file) module uses ``atomic_move()`` to operate on ``/etc/network/serivces`` or the ``dest`` specified by the module. A temporary file is created with ``tempfile.mkstemp()`` before being moved into place. The temporary file is readable and writable only by the creating user ID. If the file specified by ``path`` does not exist it will retain the permissions of the temporary file once moved into place.

pam_limits
^^^^^^^^^^

The M(pam_limits) module uses ``atomic_move()`` to operate on ``/etc/security/limits.conf`` or the value of ``dest``. A temporary file is created using ``tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()``, which is only readable and writable by the creating user ID. The temporary file will inherit the permissions of the file specified by ``dest``, or it will retain the permissions that only allow the creating user ID to read and write the file.

pamd
^^^^

The M(pamd) module uses ``atomic_move()`` to operate on a file in ``/etc/pam.d``. The path and the file can be specified by setting the ``path`` and ``name`` parameters. A temporary file is created using ``tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()``, which is only readable and writable by the creating user ID. The temporary file will inherit the permissions of the file located at ``[dest]/[name]``, or it will retain the permissions of the temporary file that only allow the creating user ID to read and write the file.

redhat_subscription
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The M(redhat_subscription) module uses ``atomic_move()`` to operate on ``/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/rhnplugin.conf`` and ``/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf``. A temporary file is created with ``tempfile.mkstemp()`` before being moved into place. The temporary file is readable and writable only by the creating user ID and the temporary file will inherit the permissions of the existing file once it is moved in to place.

selinux
^^^^^^^

The M(selinux) module uses ``atomic_move()`` to operate on ``/etc/selinux/config`` on the value specified by ``configfile``. The module will fail if ``configfile`` does not exist before any temporary data is written to disk. A temporary file is created with ``tempfile.mkstemp()`` before being moved into place. The temporary file is readable and writable only by the creating user ID. Since the file specified by ``configfile`` must exist, the temporary file will inherit the permissions of that file once it is moved in to place.

sysctl
^^^^^^

The M(sysctl) module uses ``atomic_move()`` to operate on ``/etc/sysctl.conf`` or the value specified by ``sysctl_file``. The module will fail if ``sysctl_file`` does not exist before any temporary data is written to disk. A temporary file is created with ``tempfile.mkstemp()`` before being moved into place. The temporary file is readable and writable only by the creating user ID. Since the file specified by ``sysctl_file`` must exist, the temporary file will inherit the permissions of that file once it is moved in to place.

.. warning::

	Links on this page may not point to the most recent versions of modules. We will update them when we can.


Noteworthy module changes
-------------------------

* Ansible modules created with ``add_file_common_args=True`` added a number of undocumented arguments which were mostly there to ease implementing certain action plugins. The undocumented arguments ``src``, ``follow``, ``force``, ``content``, ``backup``, ``remote_src``, ``regexp``, ``delimiter``, and ``directory_mode`` are now no longer added. Modules relying on these options to be added need to specify them by themselves.
* Ansible no longer looks for Python modules in the current working directory (typically the ``remote_user``'s home directory) when an Ansible module is run. This is to fix becoming an unprivileged user on OpenBSD and to mitigate any attack vector if the current working directory is writable by a malicious user. Install any Python modules needed to run the Ansible modules on the managed node in a system-wide location or in another directory which is in the ``remote_user``'s ``$PYTHONPATH`` and readable by the ``become_user``.


Plugins
=======

Lookup plugin names case-sensitivity
------------------------------------

* Prior to Ansible ``2.10`` lookup plugin names passed in as an argument to the ``lookup()`` function were treated as case-insensitive as opposed to lookups invoked via ``with_<lookup_name>``. ``2.10`` brings consistency to ``lookup()`` and ``with_`` to be both case-sensitive.

Noteworthy plugin changes
-------------------------

* Cache plugins in collections can be used to cache data from inventory plugins. Previously, cache plugins in collections could only be used for fact caching.
* Some undocumented arguments from ``FILE_COMMON_ARGUMENTS`` have been removed; plugins using these, in particular action plugins, need to be adjusted. The undocumented arguments which were removed are ``src``, ``follow``, ``force``, ``content``, ``backup``, ``remote_src``, ``regexp``, ``delimiter``, and ``directory_mode``.

Action plugins which execute modules should use fully-qualified module names
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Action plugins that call modules should pass explicit, fully-qualified module names to ``_execute_module()`` whenever possible (eg, ``ansible.builtin.file`` rather than ``file``). This ensures that the task's collection search order is not consulted to resolve the module. Otherwise, a module from a collection earlier in the search path could be used when not intended.

Porting Guide for v2.10.0a8
===========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- log_plays callback - add missing information to the logs generated by the callback plugin. This changes the log message format (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/442).
- pkgng - passing ``name: *`` with ``state: absent`` will no longer remove every installed package from the system. It is now a noop. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/569).
- pkgng - passing ``name: *`` with ``state: latest`` or ``state: present`` will no longer install every package from the configured package repositories. Instead, ``name: *, state: latest`` will upgrade all already-installed packages, and ``name: *, state: present`` is a noop. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/569).

community.vmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- vmware_datastore_maintenancemode - now returns ``datastore_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
- vmware_guest_custom_attributes - does not require VM name which was a required parameter for releases prior to Ansible 2.10.
- vmware_guest_find - the ``datacenter`` option has been removed.
- vmware_host_kernel_manager - now returns ``host_kernel_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.

community.vmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The vmware_dns_config module has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release; use vmware_host_dns instead.
- vca - vca_fw, vca_nat, vca_app are deprecated since these modules rely on deprecated part of Pyvcloud library.

Porting Guide for v2.10.0a5
===========================

Removed Collections
-------------------

- dellemc_networking.os10 (previously included version: 1.0.2)

Porting Guide for v2.10.0a4
===========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

ansible.windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- setup - Make sure ``ansible_date_time.epoch`` is seconds since EPOCH in UTC to mirror the POSIX facts. The ``ansible_date_time.epoch_local`` contains seconds since EPOCH in the local timezone for backwards compatibility
- setup - Will now add the IPv6 scope on link local addresses for ``ansible_ip_addresses``
- setup - ``ansible_processor`` will now return the index before the other values to match the POSIX fact behaviour
- win_find - No longer filters by size on directories, this feature had a lot of bugs, slowed down the module, and not a supported scenario with the ``find`` module.

Removed Features
----------------

community.windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- win_disk_image - removed the deprecated return value ``mount_path`` in favour of ``mount_paths``.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

ansible.windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- win_domain_computer - Deprecated the undocumented ``log_path`` option. This option will be removed in a major release after ``2022-07-01``.
- win_regedit - Deprecated using forward slashes as a path separator, use backslashes to avoid ambiguity between a forward slash in the key name or a forward slash as a path separator. This feature will be removed in a major release after ``2021-07-01``.

Porting Guide for v2.10.0a2
===========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The environment variable for the auth context for the oc.py connection plugin has been corrected (K8S_CONTEXT).  It was using an initial lowercase k by mistake. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/377).
- bigpanda - the parameter ``message`` was renamed to ``deployment_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
- cisco_spark - the module option ``message`` was renamed to ``msg``, as ``message`` is used internally in Ansible Core engine (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/39295)
- datadog - the parameter ``message`` was renamed to ``notification_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
- docker_container - no longer passes information on non-anonymous volumes or binds as ``Volumes`` to the Docker daemon. This increases compatibility with the ``docker`` CLI program. Note that if you specify ``volumes: strict`` in ``comparisons``, this could cause existing containers created with docker_container from Ansible 2.9 or earlier to restart.
- docker_container - support for port ranges was adjusted to be more compatible to the ``docker`` command line utility: a one-port container range combined with a multiple-port host range will no longer result in only the first host port be used, but the whole range being passed to Docker so that a free port in that range will be used.
- hashi_vault lookup - now returns the latest version when using the KV v2 secrets engine. Previously, it returned all versions of the secret which required additional steps to extract and filter the desired version.

community.network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- routeros_facts - allow multiple addresses and neighbors per interface. This makes ``ansible_net_neighbors`` a list instead of a dict (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/6).

Major Changes
-------------

Ansible-base
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Both ansible-doc and ansible-console's help command will error for modules and plugins whose return documentation cannot be parsed as YAML. All modules and plugins passing ``ansible-test sanity --test yamllint`` will not be affected by this.
- Collections may declare a list of supported/tested Ansible versions for the collection. A warning is issued if a collection does not support the Ansible version that loads it (can also be configured as silent or a fatal error). Collections that do not declare supported Ansible versions do not issue a warning/error.
- Plugin routing allows collections to declare deprecation, redirection targets, and removals for all plugin types.
- Plugins that import module_utils and other ansible namespaces that have moved to collections should continue to work unmodified.
- Routing data built into Ansible 2.10 ensures that 2.9 content should work unmodified on 2.10. Formerly included modules and plugins that were moved to collections are still accessible by their original unqualified names, so long as their destination collections are installed.
- When deprecations are done in code, they to specify a ``collection_name`` so that deprecation warnings can mention which collection - or ansible-base - is deprecating a feature. This affects all ``Display.deprecated()`` or ``AnsibleModule.deprecate()`` or ``Ansible.Basic.Deprecate()`` calls, and ``removed_in_version``/``removed_at_date`` or ``deprecated_aliases`` in module argument specs.
- ansible-test now uses a different ``default`` test container for Ansible Collections

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- docker_container - the ``network_mode`` option will be set by default to the name of the first network in ``networks`` if at least one network is given and ``networks_cli_compatible`` is ``true`` (will be default from community.general 2.0.0 on). Set to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings if you specify networks and set ``networks_cli_compatible`` to ``true``. The current default (not specifying it) is equivalent to the value ``default``.
- docker_container - the module has a new option, ``container_default_behavior``, whose default value will change from ``compatibility`` to ``no_defaults``. Set to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings.
- gitlab_user - no longer requires ``name``, ``email`` and ``password`` arguments when ``state=absent``.
- zabbix_action - no longer requires ``esc_period`` and ``event_source`` arguments when ``state=absent``.

community.kubernetes

Porting Guide for v2.10.0a1
===========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- ansible.windows.win_find - module has been refactored to better match the behaviour of the ``find`` module. Here is what has changed:
    * When the directory specified by ``paths`` does not exist or is a file, it will no longer fail and will just warn the user
    * Junction points are no longer reported as ``islnk``, use ``isjunction`` to properly report these files. This behaviour matches the ansible.windows.win_stat module
    * Directories no longer return a ``size``, this matches the ``stat`` and ``find`` behaviour and has been removed due to the difficulties in correctly reporting the size of a directory
- cisco.nxos.nxos_igmp_interface - no longer supports the deprecated ``oif_prefix`` and ``oif_source`` options. These have been superceeded by ``oif_ps``.
- community.grafana.grafana_dashboard - the parameter ``message`` is renamed to ``commit_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
- community.windows.win_pester - no longer runs all ``*.ps1`` file in the directory specified due to it executing potentially unknown scripts. It will follow the default behaviour of only running tests for files that are like ``*.tests.ps1`` which is built into Pester itself.
- purestorage.flashblade.purefb_fs - no longer supports the deprecated ``nfs`` option. This has been superceeded by ``nfsv3``.
