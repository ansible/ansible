==========================
Ansible 2.10 Porting Guide
==========================

.. warning::

         In Ansible 2.10, many plugins and modules have migrated to Collections on `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com>`_. Your playbooks should continue to work without any changes. We recommend you start using the fully-qualified collection name (FQCN) in your playbooks as the explicit and authoritative indicator of which collection to use as some collections may contain duplicate module names. You can search the `index of all modules <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.10/collections/index_module.html>`_ to find the collection a module has been relocated to.

This section discusses the behavioral changes between Ansible 2.9 and Ansible 2.10.

It is intended to assist in updating your playbooks, plugins and other parts of your Ansible infrastructure so they will work with this version of Ansible.

We suggest you read this page along with the `Ansible Changelog for 2.10 <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/2.10/CHANGELOG-v2.10.rst>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.

Since 2.10, Ansible consists of two parts:

* ansible-base, which includes the command line tools with a small selection of plugins and modules, and
* a `set of collections <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/2.10/ansible.in>`_.

The :ref:`porting_2.10_guide_base` is included in this porting guide. The complete list of porting guides can be found at :ref:`porting guides <porting_guides>`.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 2


Playbook
========

* Fixed a bug on boolean keywords that made random strings return 'False', now they should return an error if they are not a proper boolean
  Example: ``diff: yes-`` was returning ``False``.
* A new fact, ``ansible_processor_nproc`` reflects the number of vcpus
  available to processes (falls back to the number of vcpus available to
  the scheduler).


Command Line
============

* The ``ansible-galaxy login`` command has been removed, as the underlying API it used for GitHub auth is being shut down. Publishing roles or
  collections to Galaxy via ``ansible-galaxy`` now requires that a Galaxy API token be passed to the CLI via a token file (default location
  ``~/.ansible/galaxy_token``) or (insecurely) via the ``--token`` argument to ``ansible-galaxy``.


Deprecated
==========

* Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 will no longer be supported or tested in the next Ansible release, see :ref:`windows_faq_server2008`.


Modules
=======

.. warning::

	Links on this page may not point to the most recent versions of modules. We will update them when we can.

* Version 2.10.0 of ansible-base changed the default mode of file-based tasks to ``0o600 & ~umask`` when the user did not specify a ``mode`` parameter on file-based tasks. This was in response to a CVE report which we have reconsidered. As a result, the mode change has been reverted in 2.10.1, and mode will now default to ``0o666 & ~umask`` as in previous versions of Ansible.
* If you changed any tasks to specify less restrictive permissions while using 2.10.0, those changes will be unnecessary (but will do no harm) in 2.10.1.
* To avoid the issue raised in CVE-2020-1736, specify a ``mode`` parameter in all file-based tasks that accept it.

* ``dnf`` and ``yum`` - As of version 2.10.1, the ``dnf`` module (and ``yum`` action when it uses ``dnf``) now correctly validates GPG signatures of packages (CVE-2020-14365). If you see an error such as ``Failed to validate GPG signature for [package name]``, please ensure that you have imported the correct GPG key for the DNF repository and/or package you are using. One way to do this is with the ``rpm_key`` module. Although we discourage it, in some cases it may be necessary to disable the GPG check. This can be done by explicitly adding ``disable_gpg_check: yes`` in your ``dnf`` or ``yum`` task.


Noteworthy module changes
-------------------------

* Ansible modules created with ``add_file_common_args=True`` added a number of undocumented arguments which were mostly there to ease implementing certain action plugins. The undocumented arguments ``src``, ``follow``, ``force``, ``content``, ``backup``, ``remote_src``, ``regexp``, ``delimiter``, and ``directory_mode`` are now no longer added. Modules relying on these options to be added need to specify them by themselves.
* Ansible no longer looks for Python modules in the current working directory (typically the ``remote_user``'s home directory) when an Ansible module is run. This is to fix becoming an unprivileged user on OpenBSD and to mitigate any attack vector if the current working directory is writable by a malicious user. Install any Python modules needed to run the Ansible modules on the managed node in a system-wide location or in another directory which is in the ``remote_user``'s ``$PYTHONPATH`` and readable by the ``become_user``.


Plugins
=======

Lookup plugin names case-sensitivity
------------------------------------

* Prior to Ansible ``2.10`` lookup plugin names passed in as an argument to the ``lookup()`` function were treated as case-insensitive as opposed to lookups invoked via ``with_<lookup_name>``. ``2.10`` brings consistency to ``lookup()`` and ``with_`` to be both case-sensitive.

Noteworthy plugin changes
-------------------------

* Cache plugins in collections can be used to cache data from inventory plugins. Previously, cache plugins in collections could only be used for fact caching.
* Some undocumented arguments from ``FILE_COMMON_ARGUMENTS`` have been removed; plugins using these, in particular action plugins, need to be adjusted. The undocumented arguments which were removed are ``src``, ``follow``, ``force``, ``content``, ``backup``, ``remote_src``, ``regexp``, ``delimiter``, and ``directory_mode``.

Action plugins which execute modules should use fully-qualified module names
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Action plugins that call modules should pass explicit, fully-qualified module names to ``_execute_module()`` whenever possible (eg, ``ansible.builtin.file`` rather than ``file``). This ensures that the task's collection search order is not consulted to resolve the module. Otherwise, a module from a collection earlier in the search path could be used when not intended.

Porting custom scripts

No notable changes

Porting Guide for v2.10.7
=========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- utm_proxy_auth_profile - the ``frontend_cookie_secret`` return value now contains a placeholder string instead of the module's ``frontend_cookie_secret`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1736).

Major Changes
-------------

- Restricting the version of the community.okd collection to 1.0.0. The previously included version, 1.0.1, had a dependency on kubernetes.core and thus required the installation of an additional collection that was not included in Ansible 2.10. Version 1.0.0 is essentially identical to 1.0.1, except that it uses community.kubernetes, wihch is included in Ansible 2.10.

ovirt.ovirt
~~~~~~~~~~~

- ovirt_system_option_info - Add new module (https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-ansible-collection/pull/206).

servicenow.servicenow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- add new tests (find with no result, search many)
- add related tests
- add support for ServiceNOW table api display_value exclude_reference_link and suppress_pagination_header
- use new API for pysnow >=0.6.0

Deprecated Features
-------------------

cisco.nxos
~~~~~~~~~~

- Deprecated `nxos_bgp` and `nxos_bgp_neighbor` modules in favor of `nxos_bgp_global` resource module.

community.vmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- vmware_host_firewall_manager - the creation of new rule with no ``allowed_ip`` entry in the ``allowed_hosts`` dictionary won't be allowed after 2.0.0 release.

Porting Guide for v2.10.6
=========================

Major Changes
-------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- For community.general 2.0.0, the kubevirt modules will be moved to the `community.kubevirt <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/kubevirt>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use kubevirt modules from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``community.kubevirt.`` instead of ``community.general.``,
  for example replace ``community.general.kubevirt_vm`` in a task by ``community.kubevirt.kubevirt_vm``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.general`` manually and rely on the kubevirt modules, you have to make sure to install the ``community.kubevirt`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, for example ``community.general.kubevirt_vm`` instead of ``kubevirt_vm``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.

community.network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- For community.network 2.0.0, the Cisco NSO modules will be moved to the `cisco.nso <https://galaxy.ansible.com/cisco/nso>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use Cisco NSO modules from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``cisco.nso.`` instead of ``community.network.``,
  for example replace ``community.network.nso_config`` in a task by ``cisco.nso.nso_config``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.network`` manually and rely on the Cisco NSO modules, you have to make sure to install the ``cisco.nso`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, for example ``community.network.nso_config`` instead of ``nso_config``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.
- For community.network 2.0.0, the FortiOS modules will be moved to the `community.fortios <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible-collections/community.fortios>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use FortiOS modules from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``community.fortios.`` instead of ``community.network.``,
  for example replace ``community.network.fmgr_device`` in a task by ``community.fortios.fmgr_device``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.network`` manually and rely on the FortiOS modules, you have to make sure to install the ``community.fortios`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, for example ``community.network.fmgr_device`` instead of ``fmgr_device``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.

Major Changes
-------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- For community.general 2.0.0, the Google modules will be moved to the `community.google <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/google>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use Google modules from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``community.google.`` instead of ``community.general.``,
  for example replace ``community.general.gcpubsub`` in a task by ``community.google.gcpubsub``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.general`` manually and rely on the Google modules, you have to make sure to install the ``community.google`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, for example ``community.general.gcpubsub`` instead of ``gcpubsub``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.
- For community.general 2.0.0, the OC connection plugin will be moved to the `community.okd <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/okd>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use OC connection plugin from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs ``community.okd.oc`` instead of ``community.general.oc``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.general`` manually and rely on the OC connection plugin, you have to make sure to install the ``community.okd`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, in other words ``community.general.oc`` instead of ``oc``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust this FQCN as well.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.general`` manually and rely on the hashi_vault lookup plugin, you have to make sure to install the ``community.hashi_vault`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, in other words ``community.general.hashi_vault`` instead of ``hashi_vault``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust this FQCN as well.

netbox.netbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- nb_inventory - Add ``dns_name`` option that adds ``dns_name`` to the host when ``True`` and device has a primary IP address. (#394)
- nb_inventory - Add ``status`` as a ``group_by`` option. (398)
- nb_inventory - Move around ``extracted_primary_ip`` to allow for ``config_context`` or ``custom_field`` to overwite. (#377)

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- docker_container - currently ``published_ports`` can contain port mappings next to the special value ``all``, in which case the port mappings are ignored. This behavior is deprecated for community.docker 2.0.0, at which point it will either be forbidden, or this behavior will be properly implemented similar to how the Docker CLI tool handles this (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/8, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/60).

community.hashi_vault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- hashi_vault - ``VAULT_ADDR`` environment variable for option ``url`` will have its precedence lowered in 1.0.0; use ``ANSIBLE_HASHI_VAULT_ADDR`` to intentionally override a config value (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/8).
- hashi_vault - ``VAULT_AUTH_METHOD`` environment variable for option ``auth_method`` will be removed in 2.0.0, use ``ANSIBLE_HASHI_VAULT_AUTH_METHOD`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/17).
- hashi_vault - ``VAULT_ROLE_ID`` environment variable for option ``role_id`` will be removed in 2.0.0, use ``ANSIBLE_HASHI_VAULT_ROLE_ID`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/20).
- hashi_vault - ``VAULT_SECRET_ID`` environment variable for option ``secret_id`` will be removed in 2.0.0, use ``ANSIBLE_HASHI_VAULT_SECRET_ID`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/20).

- hashi_vault - ``VAULT_TOKEN_PATH`` environment variable for option ``token_path`` will be removed in 2.0.0, use ``ANSIBLE_HASHI_VAULT_TOKEN_PATH`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/15).

Porting Guide for v2.10.4
=========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

community.hrobot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- firewall - now requires the `ipaddress <https://pypi.org/project/ipaddress/>`_ library (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/2).

Major Changes
-------------

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- For community.general 2.0.0, the Hetzner Robot modules will be moved to the `community.hrobot <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/hrobot>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use Hetzner Robot modules from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``community.hrobot.`` instead of ``community.general.hetzner_``,
  for example replace ``community.general.hetzner_firewall_info`` in a task by ``community.hrobot.firewall_info``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.general`` manually and rely on the Hetzner Robot modules, you have to make sure to install the ``community.hrobot`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, i.e. ``community.general.hetzner_failover_ip`` instead of ``hetzner_failover_ip``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.
- For community.general 2.0.0, the ``docker`` modules and plugins will be moved to the `community.docker <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/docker>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use ``docker`` content from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``community.docker.`` instead of ``community.general.``,
  for example replace ``community.general.docker_container`` in a task by ``community.docker.docker_container``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.general`` manually and rely on the ``docker`` content, you have to make sure to install the ``community.docker`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, i.e. ``community.general.docker_container`` instead of ``docker_container``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.
- For community.general 2.0.0, the ``postgresql`` modules and plugins will be moved to the `community.postgresql <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/postgresql>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use ``postgresql`` content from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``community.postgresql.`` instead of ``community.general.``,
  for example replace ``community.general.postgresql_info`` in a task by ``community.postgresql.postgresql_info``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.general`` manually and rely on the ``postgresql`` content, you have to make sure to install the ``community.postgresql`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, i.e. ``community.general.postgresql_info`` instead of ``postgresql_info``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.
- The community.general collection no longer depends on the ansible.posix collection (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1157).

community.network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- For community.network 2.0.0, the ``routeros`` modules and plugins will be moved to the `community.routeros <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/routeros>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use ``routeros`` content from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``community.routeros.`` instead of ``community.network.routeros_``,
  for example replace ``community.network.routeros_api`` in a task by ``community.routeros.api``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.network`` manually and rely on the ``routeros`` content, you have to make sure to install the ``community.routeros`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, i.e. ``community.network.routeros_command`` instead of ``routeros_command``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.
- In community.network 2.0.0, the ``fortimanager`` httpapi plugin will be removed and replaced by a redirect to the corresponding plugin in the fortios.fortimanager collection. For Ansible 2.10 and ansible-base 2.10 users, this means that it will continue to work assuming that collection is installed. For Ansible 2.9 users, this means that they have to adjust the FQCN from ``community.network.fortimanager`` to ``fortios.fortimanager.fortimanager`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/151).

community.okd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add custom k8s module, integrate better Molecule tests (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.okd/pull/7).

cisco.nxos
~~~~~~~~~~

- Deprecated `nxos_smu` in favour of `nxos_rpm` module.
- The `nxos_ospf_vrf` module is deprecated by `nxos_ospfv2` and `nxos_ospfv3` Resource Modules.

Porting Guide for v2.10.0
=========================

Known Issues
------------

- Due to a limitation in pip, you cannot ``pip install --upgrade`` from ansible-2.9 or earlier to ansible-2.10 or higher. Instead, you must explicitly use ``pip uninstall ansible`` before pip installing the new version. If you attempt to upgrade Ansible with pip without first uninstalling, the installer warns you to uninstall first.
- The individual collections that make up the ansible-2.10.0 package can be viewed independently. However, they are not currently listed by ansible-galaxy. To view these collections with ansible-galaxy, explicitly specify where ansible has installed the collections -- ``COLLECTION_INSTALL=$(python -c 'import ansible, os.path ; print("%s/../ansible_collections" % os.path.dirname(ansible.__file__))') ansible-galaxy collection list -p "$COLLECTION_INSTALL"``.
- These fortios modules are not automatically redirected from their 2.9.x names to the new 2.10.x names within collections. You must modify your playbooks to use fully qualified collection names for them. You can use the documentation (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.10/collections/fortinet/fortios/) for the ``fortinet.fortios`` collection to determine what the fully qualified collection names are.

community.grafana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- grafana_datasource doesn't set password correctly (#113)

Breaking Changes
----------------

- cisco.nxos.nxos_igmp_interface - no longer supports the deprecated ``oif_prefix`` and ``oif_source`` options. These have been superceeded by ``oif_ps``.
- community.grafana.grafana_dashboard - the parameter ``message`` is renamed to ``commit_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
- purestorage.flashblade.purefb_fs - no longer supports the deprecated ``nfs`` option. This has been superceeded by ``nfsv3``.

amazon.aws
~~~~~~~~~~

- aws_s3 - can now delete versioned buckets even when they are not empty - set mode to delete to delete a versioned bucket and everything in it.

ansible.windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- setup - Make sure ``ansible_date_time.epoch`` is seconds since EPOCH in UTC to mirror the POSIX facts. The ``ansible_date_time.epoch_local`` contains seconds since EPOCH in the local timezone for backwards compatibility
- setup - Will now add the IPv6 scope on link local addresses for ``ansible_ip_addresses``
- setup - ``ansible_processor`` will now return the index before the other values to match the POSIX fact behaviour
- win_find - No longer filters by size on directories, this feature had a lot of bugs, slowed down the module, and not a supported scenario with the ``find`` module.
- win_find - module has been refactored to better match the behaviour of the ``find`` module. Here is what has changed:
    * When the directory specified by ``paths`` does not exist or is a file, it will no longer fail and will just warn the user
    * Junction points are no longer reported as ``islnk``, use ``isjunction`` to properly report these files. This behaviour matches the win_stat module
    * Directories no longer return a ``size``, this matches the ``stat`` and ``find`` behaviour and has been removed due to the difficulties in correctly reporting the size of a directory
- win_user - Change idempotency checks for ``description`` to be case sensitive
- win_user - Change idempotency checks for ``fullname`` to be case sensitive

cisco.meraki
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- meraki_device - Changed tags from string to list
- meraki_device - Removed serial_lldp_cdp parameter
- meraki_device - Removed serial_uplink parameter
- meraki_intrusion_prevention - Rename whitedlisted_rules to allowed_rules

- meraki_network - `disable_my_meraki` has been deprecated
- meraki_network - `enable_my_meraki` is now called `local_status_page_enabled`
- meraki_network - `enable_remote_status_page` is now called `remote_status_page_enabled`
- meraki_network - `enabled` response for VLAN status is now `vlans_enabled`
- meraki_network - `tags` and `type` now return a list
- meraki_snmp - peer_ips is now a list
- meraki_switchport - `access_policy_number` is now an int and not a string
- meraki_switchport - `tags` is now a list and not a string
- meraki_webhook - Querying test status now uses state of query.

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The environment variable for the auth context for the oc.py connection plugin has been corrected (K8S_CONTEXT).  It was using an initial lowercase k by mistake. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/377).
- bigpanda - the parameter ``message`` was renamed to ``deployment_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
- cisco_spark - the module option ``message`` was renamed to ``msg``, as ``message`` is used internally in Ansible Core engine (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/39295)
- datadog - the parameter ``message`` was renamed to ``notification_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
- docker_container - no longer passes information on non-anonymous volumes or binds as ``Volumes`` to the Docker daemon. This increases compatibility with the ``docker`` CLI program. Note that if you specify ``volumes: strict`` in ``comparisons``, this could cause existing containers created with docker_container from Ansible 2.9 or earlier to restart.
- docker_container - support for port ranges was adjusted to be more compatible to the ``docker`` command line utility: a one-port container range combined with a multiple-port host range will no longer result in only the first host port be used, but the whole range being passed to Docker so that a free port in that range will be used.
- hashi_vault lookup - now returns the latest version when using the KV v2 secrets engine. Previously, it returned all versions of the secret which required additional steps to extract and filter the desired version.
- log_plays callback - add missing information to the logs generated by the callback plugin. This changes the log message format (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/442).
- pkgng - passing ``name: *`` with ``state: absent`` will no longer remove every installed package from the system. It is now a noop. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/569).
- pkgng - passing ``name: *`` with ``state: latest`` or ``state: present`` will no longer install every package from the configured package repositories. Instead, ``name: *, state: latest`` will upgrade all already-installed packages, and ``name: *, state: present`` is a noop. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/569).

community.network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- routeros_facts - allow multiple addresses and neighbors per interface. This makes ``ansible_net_neighbors`` a list instead of a dict (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/6).

community.vmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- vmware_datastore_maintenancemode - now returns ``datastore_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
- vmware_guest_custom_attributes - does not require VM name which was a required parameter for releases prior to Ansible 2.10.
- vmware_guest_find - the ``datacenter`` option has been removed.
- vmware_host_kernel_manager - now returns ``host_kernel_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
- vmware_host_ntp - now returns ``host_ntp_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
- vmware_host_service_manager - now returns ``host_service_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
- vmware_tag - now returns ``tag_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
- vmware_vmkernel - the options ``ip_address`` and ``subnet_mask`` have been removed; use the suboptions ``ip_address`` and ``subnet_mask`` of the ``network`` option instead.

community.windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- win_pester - no longer runs all ``*.ps1`` file in the directory specified due to it executing potentially unknown scripts. It will follow the default behaviour of only running tests for files that are like ``*.tests.ps1`` which is built into Pester itself.

community.zabbix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- zabbix_javagateway - options ``javagateway_pidfile``, ``javagateway_listenip``, ``javagateway_listenport`` and ``javagateway_startpollers`` renamed to ``zabbix_javagateway_xyz`` (see `UPGRADE.md <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.zabbix/blob/main/docs/UPGRADE.md>`_).

netbox.netbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Change ``ip-addresses`` key in netbox inventory plugin to ``ip_addresses`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/139)
- Changed ``group`` to ``tenant_group`` in ``netbox_tenant.py`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/9)
- Changed ``role`` to ``prefix_role`` in ``netbox_prefix.py`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/9)
- Module failures when required fields arent provided (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/24)
- Renamed ``netbox_interface`` to ``netbox_device_interface`` (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/issues/9)
- This version has a few breaking changes due to new namespace and collection name. I felt it necessary to change the name of the lookup plugin and inventory plugin just not to have a non descriptive namespace call to use them. Below is an example:
  ``netbox.netbox.netbox`` would be used for both inventory plugin and lookup plugin, but in different contexts so no collision will arise, but confusion will.
  I renamed the lookup plugin to ``nb_lookup`` so it will be used with the FQCN ``netbox.netbox.nb_lookup``.
  The inventory plugin will now be called within an inventory file by ``netbox.netbox.nb_inventory``
- To pass in integers via Ansible Jinja filters for a key in ``data`` that
  requires querying an endpoint is now done by making it a dictionary with
  an ``id`` key. The previous behavior was to just pass in an integer and
  it was converted when normalizing the data, but some people may have names
  that are all integers and those were being converted erroneously so we made
  the decision to change the method to convert to an integer for the NetBox
  API.

    tasks:
      - name: Create device within NetBox with only required information

- ``pynetbox`` changed to using ``requests.Session()`` to manage the HTTP session
  which broke passing in ``ssl_verify`` when building the NetBox API client.
  This PR makes ``pynetbox 5.0.4+`` the new required version of `pynetbox` for
  the Ansible modules and lookup plugin. (https://github.com/netbox-community/ansible_modules/pull/269)

theforeman.foreman
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- All modules were renamed to drop the ``foreman_`` and ``katello_`` prefixes.
  Additionally to the prefix removal, the following modules were further ranamed:

  * katello_upload to content_upload
  * katello_sync to repository_sync
  * katello_manifest to subscription_manifest
  * foreman_search_facts to resource_info
  * foreman_ptable to partition_table
  * foreman_model to hardware_model
  * foreman_environment to puppet_environment

Major Changes
-------------

Ansible-base
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Both ansible-doc and ansible-console's help command will error for modules and plugins whose return documentation cannot be parsed as YAML. All modules and plugins passing ``ansible-test sanity --test yamllint`` will not be affected by this.
- Collections may declare a list of supported/tested Ansible versions for the collection. A warning is issued if a collection does not support the Ansible version that loads it (can also be configured as silent or a fatal error). Collections that do not declare supported Ansible versions do not issue a warning/error.
- Plugin routing allows collections to declare deprecation, redirection targets, and removals for all plugin types.
- Plugins that import module_utils and other ansible namespaces that have moved to collections should continue to work unmodified.
- Routing data built into Ansible 2.10 ensures that 2.9 content should work unmodified on 2.10. Formerly included modules and plugins that were moved to collections are still accessible by their original unqualified names, so long as their destination collections are installed.
- When deprecations are done in code, they to specify a ``collection_name`` so that deprecation warnings can mention which collection - or ansible-base - is deprecating a feature. This affects all ``Display.deprecated()`` or ``AnsibleModule.deprecate()`` or ``Ansible.Basic.Deprecate()`` calls, and ``removed_in_version``/``removed_at_date`` or ``deprecated_aliases`` in module argument specs.
- ansible-test now uses a different ``default`` test container for Ansible Collections

amazon.aws
~~~~~~~~~~

- ec2 module_utils - The ``AWSRetry`` decorator no longer catches ``NotFound`` exceptions by default.  ``NotFound`` exceptions need to be explicitly added using ``catch_extra_error_codes``.  Some AWS modules may see an increase in transient failures due to AWS''s eventual consistency model.

ansible.netcommon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add libssh connection plugin and refactor network_cli (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.netcommon/pull/30)

ansible.posix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- meraki_mr_rf_profile - Configure wireless RF profiles.
- meraki_mr_settings - Configure network settings for wireless.
- meraki_ms_l3_interface - New module

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- docker_container - the ``network_mode`` option will be set by default to the name of the first network in ``networks`` if at least one network is given and ``networks_cli_compatible`` is ``true`` (will be default from community.general 2.0.0 on). Set to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings if you specify networks and set ``networks_cli_compatible`` to ``true``. The current default (not specifying it) is equivalent to the value ``default``.
- docker_container - the module has a new option, ``container_default_behavior``, whose default value will change from ``compatibility`` to ``no_defaults``. Set to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings.
- gitlab_user - no longer requires ``name``, ``email`` and ``password`` arguments when ``state=absent``.
