Introduction
============

Before we start exploring the main components of Ansible -- playbooks, configuration management, deployment, and orchestration -- we'll learn how to get Ansible installed and cover some basic concepts.  We'll also go over how to execute ad-hoc commands in parallel across your nodes using /usr/bin/ansible, and see what modules are available in Ansible's core (you can also write your own, which is covered later).
