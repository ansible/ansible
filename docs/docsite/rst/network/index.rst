Ansible for Network Automation
******************************

Ansible Network modules extend the benefits of simple, powerful, agentless automation to network administrators and teams. Ansible Network modules can configure your network stack, test and validate existing network state, and discover and correct network configuration drift.

If you're new to Ansible, or new to using Ansible for network management, start with :ref:`network_getting_started`. If you are already familiar with network automation with Ansible, see :ref:`network_advanced`.

For documentation on using a particular network module, consult the :ref:`list of all network modules<network_modules>`. Some network modules are maintained by the Ansible community - here's a list of :ref:`network modules maintained by the Ansible Network Team<network_supported>`.
