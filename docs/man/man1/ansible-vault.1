.SH "NAME"
ansible-vault \- manage encrypted YAML data\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
ansible\-vault [create|decrypt|edit|encrypt|rekey] [\-\-help] [options] file_name
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBansible\-vault\fR can encrypt any structured data file used by Ansible\&. This can include \fBgroup_vars/\fR or \fBhost_vars/\fR inventory variables, variables loaded by \fBinclude_vars\fR or \fBvars_files\fR, or variable files passed on the ansible\-playbook command line with \fB\-e @file\&.yml\fR or \fB\-e @file\&.json\fR\&. Role variables and defaults are also included!
.sp
Because Ansible tasks, handlers, and so on are also data, these can also be encrypted with vault\&. If you\(cqd like to not betray what variables you are even using, you can go as far to keep an individual task file entirely encrypted\&.
.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"
.sp
The following options are available to all sub\-commands:
.PP
\fB\-\-vault\-password\-file=\fR\fIFILE\fR
.RS 4
A file containing the vault password to be used during the encryption/decryption steps\&. Be sure to keep this file secured if it is used\&. If the file is executable, it will be run and its standard output will be used as the password\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-new\-vault\-password\-file=\fR\fIFILE\fR
.RS 4
A file containing the new vault password to be used when rekeying a file\&. Be sure to keep this file secured if it is used\&. If the file is executable, it will be run and its standard output will be used as the password\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Show a help message related to the given sub\-command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
.RS 4
Enable debugging output for troubleshooting\&.
.RE
.SH "CREATE"
.sp
\fB$ ansible\-vault create [options] FILE\fR
.sp
The \fBcreate\fR sub\-command is used to initialize a new encrypted file\&.
.sp
First you will be prompted for a password\&. The password used with vault currently must be the same for all files you wish to use together at the same time\&.
.sp
After providing a password, the tool will launch whatever editor you have defined with $EDITOR, and defaults to vim\&. Once you are done with the editor session, the file will be saved as encrypted data\&.
.sp
The default cipher is AES (which is shared\-secret based)\&.
.SH "EDIT"
.sp
\fB$ ansible\-vault edit [options] FILE\fR
.sp
The \fBedit\fR sub\-command is used to modify a file which was previously encrypted using ansible\-vault\&.
.sp
This command will decrypt the file to a temporary file and allow you to edit the file, saving it back when done and removing the temporary file\&.
.SH "REKEY"
.sp
\fB$ ansible\-vault rekey [options] FILE_1 [FILE_2, \&..., FILE_N]\fR
.sp
The \fBrekey\fR command is used to change the password on a vault\-encrypted files\&. This command can update multiple files at once, and will prompt for both the old and new passwords before modifying any data\&.
.SH "ENCRYPT"
.sp
\fB$ ansible\-vault encrypt [options] FILE_1 [FILE_2, \&..., FILE_N]\fR
.sp
The \fBencrypt\fR sub\-command is used to encrypt pre\-existing data files\&. As with the \fBrekey\fR command, you can specify multiple files in one command\&.
.sp
Starting with version 2\&.0, the \fBencrypt\fR command accepts an \fB\-\-output FILENAME\fR option to determine where encrypted output is stored\&. With this option, input is read from the (at most one) filename given on the command line; if no input file is given, input is read from stdin\&. Either the input or the output file may be given as \fI\-\fR for stdin and stdout respectively\&. If neither input nor output file is given, the command acts as a filter, reading plaintext from stdin and writing it to stdout\&.
.sp
Thus any of the following invocations can be used:
.sp
\fB$ ansible\-vault encrypt\fR
.sp
\fB$ ansible\-vault encrypt \-\-output OUTFILE\fR
.sp
\fB$ ansible\-vault encrypt INFILE \-\-output OUTFILE\fR
.sp
\fB$ echo secret|ansible\-vault encrypt \-\-output OUTFILE\fR
.sp
Reading from stdin and writing only encrypted output is a good way to prevent sensitive data from ever hitting disk (either interactively or from a script)\&.
.SH "DECRYPT"
.sp
\fB$ ansible\-vault decrypt [options] FILE_1 [FILE_2, \&..., FILE_N]\fR
.sp
The \fBdecrypt\fR sub\-command is used to remove all encryption from data files\&. The files will be stored as plain\-text YAML once again, so be sure that you do not run this command on data files with active passwords or other sensitive data\&. In most cases, users will want to use the \fBedit\fR sub\-command to modify the files securely\&.
.sp
As with \fBencrypt\fR, the \fBdecrypt\fR subcommand also accepts the \fB\-\-output FILENAME\fR option to specify where plaintext output is stored, and stdin/stdout is handled as described above\&.
