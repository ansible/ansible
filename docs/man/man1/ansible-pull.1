.SH "NAME"
ansible-pull \- set up a remote copy of ansible on each managed node
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
ansible \-d DEST \-U URL [ \-C CHECKOUT ] [ \-i INVENTORY ] [ <filename\&.yml> ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBAnsible\fR is an extra\-simple tool/framework/API for doing \'remote things\' over SSH\&.
.sp
Use ansible\-pull to set up a remote copy of ansible on each managed node, each set to run via cron and update playbook source via git\&. This inverts the default \fBpush\fR architecture of ansible into a \fBpull\fR architecture, which has near\-limitless scaling potential\&.
.sp
The setup playbook can be tuned to change the cron frequency, logging locations, and parameters to ansible\-pull\&.
.sp
This is useful both for extreme scale\-out as well as periodic remediation\&. Usage of the \fIfetch\fR module to retrieve logs from ansible\-pull runs would be an excellent way to gather and analyze remote logs from ansible\-pull\&.
.SH "OPTIONAL ARGUMENT"
.PP
\fBfilename\&.yml\fR
.RS 4
The name of one the YAML format files to run as an ansible playbook\&. This can be a relative path within the git checkout\&. If not provided, ansible\-pull will look for a playbook based on the host\(cqs fully\-qualified domain name and finally a playbook named
\fBlocal\&.yml\fR\&.

.PP
\fB\-i\fR \fIPATH\fR, \fB\-\-inventory=\fR\fIPATH\fR
