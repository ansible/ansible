NAME
----
ansible-pull - pull playbooks from VCS server and run them using this machine as the target.


SYNOPSIS
--------
ansible-pull -U URL [options] [ <filename.yml> ]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*Ansible* is an extra-simple tool/framework/API for doing \'remote things'.

Use ansible-pull to set up a remote copy of ansible on each managed
node, each set to run via cron and update playbook source via
a source repository. This inverts the default *push* architecture of
ansible into a *pull* architecture, which has near-limitless scaling
potential.

The setup playbook can be tuned to change the cron frequency, logging
locations, and parameters to ansible-pull.

This is useful both for extreme scale-out as well as periodic
remediation. Usage of the 'fetch' module to retrieve logs from
ansible-pull runs would be an excellent way to gather and analyze
remote logs from ansible-pull.


OPTIONAL ARGUMENT
-----------------

*filename.yml*::

The name of one the YAML format files to run as an ansible playbook.  This can
be a relative path within the checkout.  If not provided, ansible-pull
will look for a playbook based on the host's fully-qualified domain name, on the
host hostname and finally a playbook named *local.yml*.


OPTIONS
-------

*--accept-host-key*::

Adds the hostkey for the repo URL if not already added.

*--ask-become-pass*::

Ask for privilege escalation password.

*-k*, *--ask-pass*::

Prompt for the connection password, if it is needed for the transport used.
For example, using ssh and not having  a key-based authentication with ssh-agent.

*--ask-su-pass*::

Prompt for su password, used with --su (deprecated, use become).

*-K*, *--ask-sudo-pass*::

Prompt for the password to use with --sudo, if any (deprecated, use become).

*--ask-vault-pass*::

Prompt for vault password.

*-C* 'CHECKOUT', *--checkout=*'CHECKOUT'::

Branch/Tag/Commit to checkout.  If not provided, uses default behavior of module used to check out playbook repository.

*-d* 'DEST', *--directory=*'DEST'::

Directory to checkout repository into. If not provided, a subdirectory of ~/.ansible/pull/ will be used.

*-e* 'EXTRA_VARS', *--extra-vars=*'EXTRA_VARS::

Extra variables to inject into a playbook, in key=value key=value format or
as quoted YAML/JSON (hashes and arrays). To load variables from a file, specify
the file preceded by @ (e.g. @vars.yml).

*-f*, *--force*::

Force running of playbook even if unable to update playbook repository.  This
can be useful, for example, to enforce run-time state when a network
connection may not always be up or possible.

*--full*::

Do a full clone of the repository. By default ansible-pull will do a shallow clone based on the last revision.

*-h*, *--help*::

Show the help message and exit.

*-i* 'PATH', *--inventory=*'PATH'::

The 'PATH' to the inventory, which defaults to '/etc/ansible/hosts'.
Alternatively you can use a comma separated list of hosts or single host with traling comma 'host,'.

*--private-key=*'PRIVATE_KEY_FILE'::

Use this file to authenticate the connection.

*-m* 'NAME', *--module-name=*'NAME'::

Module used to checkout playbook repository.  Defaults to git.

*-o*, *--only-if-changed*::

Only run the playbook if the repository has been updated.

*--purge*::

Purge the checkout after the playbook is run.

*-s* 'SLEEP', *--sleep=*'SLEEP'::

Sleep for random interval (between 0 and SLEEP number of seconds) before starting.  This is a useful way ot disperse git requests.

*--ssh-common-args=*''-o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p ..." ...''::

set a ProxyCommand to use a jump host, but any arguments that are

*-t* 'TAGS', *--tags=*'TAGS'::

*--vault-password-file=*'VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE'::

Vault password file.

INVENTORY
---------

Ansible stores the hosts it can potentially operate on in an inventory.
This can be an ini-like file, a script, directory or a list.
The ini syntax is one host per line.  Groups headers are allowed and
are included on their own line, enclosed in square brackets that start the line.

Ranges of hosts are also supported.  For more information and
additional options, see the documentation on http://docs.ansible.com/.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------

The following environment variables may be specified.

ANSIBLE_INVENTORY  -- Override the default ansible inventory file

ANSIBLE_LIBRARY -- Override the default ansible module library path

ANSIBLE_CONFIG -- Override the default ansible config file

Many more are available for most options in ansible.cfg


FILES
-----

/etc/ansible/hosts -- Default inventory file

/usr/share/ansible/ -- Default module library

/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg -- Config file, used if present

~/.ansible.cfg -- User config file, overrides the default config if present
