." ------ DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The command module takes the command name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments. 
.PP
The given command will be executed on all selected nodes. It will not be processed through the shell, so variables like \fC$HOME\fR and operations like \fC"<"\fR, \fC">"\fR, \fC"|"\fR, and \fC"&"\fR will not work. As such, all paths to commands must be fully qualified

.SH NOTES
.PP
If you want to run a command through the shell (say you are using \fC<\fR, \fC>\fR, \fC|\fR, etc), you actually want the \fIshell\fR module instead. The \fIcommand\fR module is much more secure as it's not affected by the user's environment.
