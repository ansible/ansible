      Source files for Ansible community documentation are
      hosted in different repositories. Please make sure to file an
      issue in the correct project.

      Documentation for modules/plugins/etc that are officially
      supported by the Ansible Core Engineering team is available
      in this (`ansible/ansible`) repository.

      The Installation Guide, Playbook Guide, Developer Guide,
      and other documentation is available in the
      [ansible/ansible-documentation] repository.
      Documentation for other modules/plugins/etc is likely to be
      available in one of the [Ansible Collections][collections index].
      If available in the collection documentation, select the
      **Issue Tracker** button to go directly to the GitHub issues.

      I was reading the ansible-core documentation of version X and I'm having
