# Ansible Alibaba Cloud(Alicloud) ECS dynamic inventory script settings

[ecs]

# Alicloud regions to make calls to. Set this to 'all' to make request to all regions
# in Alicloud and then merge the results together. Alternatively, set this to a comma
# separated list of regions. For example, regions = cn-beijing,eu-central-1,ap-southeast-1,us-east-1
#regions = all
regions = cn-beijing

# In addition, set 'regions_exclude' to a comma separated list of regions to filter 'all' regions.
#regions_exclude = us-west-1,ap-northeast-1


# When generating inventory, Ansible needs to know how to address a ECS instance.
# Each ECS instance has server ip address variables associated with it.
# This destination_variable is used as the address of a server, and it support
# following value:
#   - public_ip_address: return the public IP address or elastic ip address of the ECS server
#   - private_ip_address: return the inner or private IP address of the ECS server
# WARNING: For instances in a private subnet, this should be set to 'private_ip_address',
#           and Ansible must be run from within the subnet.
destination_variable = public_ip_address


# This allows you to override the inventory_name with an ecs server attribute,
# instead of using the destination_variable above. Addressing (aka ansible_ssh_host)
# will still use destination_variable.
# WARNING: ECS server attribute 'tags' should be written as 'tag_TAGNAME',
#           E.g. hostname_variable = tag_my-ansible
hostname_variable = instance_id


# By default, only ECS instances in the 'running' status are returned.
# Set 'all_instances' to True to return instances in all status.
# Set instance_states to return as a comma-separated list. This
# option will be overriden when 'all_instances' is True.
all_instances = True
# instance_states = pending, running, starting, stopping, stopped


# In order to avoiding calling Alicloud API frequently, we cache the results of an API call.
# Set this to the path you want cache files to be written to. Two files
# will be written to this directory:
#   - ansible-alicloud.cache
#   - ansible-alicloud.index
cache_path = ~/.ansible/tmp

# seconds, a new API call will be made, and the cache file will be updated.
# To disable the cache, set this value to 0

# If set this to true, any tag of the form "a,b,c" will be expanded into a list

# The filters are key/value pairs separated by '=', to list multiple filters use

# Supplying Alicloud credentials here is not recommended, as it introduces
