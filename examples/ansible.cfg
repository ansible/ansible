# finds first

# file socket names (108 characters for most platforms). In that case, you 
# may wish to shorten the string below.

# Example: 
# control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r
#control_path = %(directory)s/ansible-ssh-%%h-%%p-%%r

# Enabling pipelining reduces the number of SSH operations required to 
# execute a module on the remote server. This can result in a significant 
# performance improvement when enabled, however when using "sudo:" you must 
# first disable 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers
#
# By default, this option is disabled to preserve compatibility with
# sudoers configurations that have requiretty (the default on many distros).
