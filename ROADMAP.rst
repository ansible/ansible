Roadmap For Ansible by Red Hat
*******************************
This document is now the location for published Ansible Core roadmaps.

The roadmap will be updated by version. Based on team and community feedback, an initial roadmap will be published for a major or minor version (2.0, 2.1).  Subminor versions will generally not have roadmaps published.

2.1 was the first time Ansible has published this and asked for feedback in this manner.  So feedback on the roadmap and the new process is quite welcome.  The team is aiming for further transparency and better inclusion of both community desires and submissions.

These roadmaps are the team's *best guess* roadmaps based on the Ansible team's experience and are also based on requests and feedback from the community.  There are things that may not make it on due to time constraints, lack of community maintainers, etc.  And there may be things that got missed, so each roadmap is published both as an idea of what is upcoming in Ansible, and as a medium for seeking further feedback from the community. Here are the good places for you to submit feedback:

- Add to the agenda of a `Core IRC Meetings <https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/master/meetings/README.md>`_ (preferred)
- Ansible's google-group: ansible-devel
- AnsibleFest conferences.
- IRC Freenode channel: #ansible-devel (this one may have things lost in lots of conversation, so a caution).

Ansible Roadmaps can be found `here <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/roadmap/>`_.
