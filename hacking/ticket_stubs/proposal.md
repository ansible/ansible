Hi!

Ansible has a Proposal process for large feature ideas or changes in current design and functionality, such as this.
If you are still interested in seeing this new feature get into Ansible, please submit a proposal for it using this process.

<https://github.com/ansible/proposals/blob/master/proposals_process_proposal.md>

Because this project is very active, we're unlikely to see comments made on closed tickets and we lock them after some time.
The Forum is the best ways to ask questions, or post if you don't think this particular issue is resolved.

* <https://forum.ansible.com/tag/ansible-core>

Or check this page for a more complete list of communication channels and their purposes:

* <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html>

Thank you!
