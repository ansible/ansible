# When generating inventory, Ansible needs to know how to address a server.
# Each EC2 instance has a lot of variables associated with it. Here is the list:
#   http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/ref/ec2.html#module-boto.ec2.instance
# Below are 2 variables that are used as the address of a server:
#   - destination_variable
#   - vpc_destination_variable

# This is the normal destination variable to use. If you are running Ansible
# from outside EC2, then 'public_dns_name' makes the most sense. If you are
# running Ansible from within EC2, then perhaps you want to use the internal
# address, and should set this to 'private_dns_name'. The key of an EC2 tag
# may optionally be used; however the boto instance variables hold precedence
# in the event of a collision.
destination_variable = public_dns_name

# For server inside a VPC, using DNS names may not make sense. When an instance
# has 'subnet_id' set, this variable is used. If the subnet is public, setting
# this to 'ip_address' will return the public IP address. For instances in a
# private subnet, this should be set to 'private_ip_address', and Ansible must
# be run from with EC2. The key of an EC2 tag may optionally be used; however
# the boto instance variables hold precedence in the event of a collision.
vpc_destination_variable = ip_address

# To tag instances on EC2 with the resource records that point to them from
# Route53, uncomment and set 'route53' to True.
route53 = False

# To exclude RDS instances from the inventory, uncomment and set to False.
#rds = False

# Additionally, you can specify the list of zones to exclude looking up in
# 'route53_excluded_zones' as a comma-separated list.
# route53_excluded_zones = samplezone1.com, samplezone2.com

# By default, only EC2 instances in the 'running' state are returned. Set
# 'all_instances' to True to return all instances regardless of state.
all_instances = False

# By default, only RDS instances in the 'available' state are returned.  Set
# 'all_rds_instances' to True return all RDS instances regardless of state.
all_rds_instances = False

# API calls to EC2 are slow. For this reason, we cache the results of an API
# call. Set this to the path you want cache files to be written to. Two files
# will be written to this directory:
#   - ansible-ec2.cache
#   - ansible-ec2.index
cache_path = ~/.ansible/tmp

# The number of seconds a cache file is considered valid. After this many
# seconds, a new API call will be made, and the cache file will be updated.
# To disable the cache, set this value to 0
cache_max_age = 300

# Organize groups into a nested/hierarchy instead of a flat namespace.
nested_groups = False

# If you only want to include hosts that match a certain regular expression
# pattern_include = stage-*

# If you want to exclude any hosts that match a certain regular expression

# Instance filters can be used to control which instances are retrieved for
# inventory. For the full list of possible filters, please read the EC2 API
# docs: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-DescribeInstances.html#query-DescribeInstances-filters
# Filters are key/value pairs separated by '=', to list multiple filters use
# a list separated by commas. See examples below.

# Retrieve only instances with (key=value) env=stage tag
# instance_filters = tag:env=stage

# Retrieve only instances with role=webservers OR role=dbservers tag
# instance_filters = tag:role=webservers,tag:role=dbservers

# Retrieve only t1.micro instances OR instances with tag env=stage
# instance_filters = instance-type=t1.micro,tag:env=stage

# You can use wildcards in filter values also. Below will list instances which
# tag Name value matches webservers1*
# (ex. webservers15, webservers1a, webservers123 etc) 
# instance_filters = tag:Name=webservers1*
