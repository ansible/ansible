# When generating inventory, Ansible needs to know how to address a server.
# Each EC2 instance has a lot of variables associated with it. Here is the list:
#   http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/ref/ec2.html#module-boto.ec2.instance
# Below are 2 variables that are used as the address of a server:
#   - destination_variable
#   - vpc_destination_variable

# This is the normal destination variable to use. If you are running Ansible
# from outside EC2, then 'public_dns_name' makes the most sense. If you are
# running Ansible from within EC2, then perhaps you want to use the internal
# address, and should set this to 'private_dns_name'.
destination_variable = public_dns_name

# For server inside a VPC, using DNS names may not make sense. When an instance
# has 'subnet_id' set, this variable is used. If the subnet is public, setting
# this to 'ip_address' will return the public IP address. For instances in a
# private subnet, this should be set to 'private_ip_address', and Ansible must
# be run from with EC2.
vpc_destination_variable = ip_address

# To tag instances on EC2 with the resource records that point to them from
# Route53, uncomment and set 'route53' to True.
route53 = False

# Additionally, you can specify the list of zones to exclude looking up in
# 'route53_excluded_zones' as a comma-separated list.
# route53_excluded_zones = samplezone1.com, samplezone2.com

# API calls to EC2 are slow. For this reason, we cache the results of an API
# call. Set this to the path you want cache files to be written to. Two files
# will be written to this directory:
#   - ansible-ec2.cache
#   - ansible-ec2.index
cache_path = ~/.ansible/tmp

# The number of seconds a cache file is considered valid. After this many
# seconds, a new API call will be made, and the cache file will be updated.
cache_max_age = 300
