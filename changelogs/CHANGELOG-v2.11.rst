Bugfixes
--------

- Add RockyLinux to fact gathering (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74530).
- Improve resilience of ``ansible-galaxy collection`` by increasing the page size to make fewer requests overall and retrying queries with a jittered exponential backoff when rate limiting HTTP codes (520 and 429) occur. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74191)
- Prevent ``ansible_failed_task`` from further templating (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74036)

- The error message about the failure to import a ``gpg`` key by the ``apt_key`` module was incorrect (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74423).
- ansible-test - Avoid publishing the port used by the ``pypi-test-container`` since it is only accessed by other containers. This avoids issues when trying to run tests in parallel on a single host.
- ansible-test - Fix docker container IP address detection. The ``bridge`` network is no longer assumed to be the default.
- ansible-test - Use documented API to retrieve build information from Azure Pipelines.
- ansible.builtin.cron - Keep non-empty crontabs, when removing cron jobs (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74497).

- ansible_test - add constraint for ``MarkupSafe`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74666)
- apt_key - Binary GnuPG keys downloaded via URLs were corrupted so GnuPG could not import them (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74424).
- become - fix a regression on Solaris where chmod can return 5 which we interpret as auth failure and stop trying become tmpdir permission fallbacks
- become - work around setfacl not existing on modern Solaris (and possibly failing on some filesystems even when it does exist)
- callback default, now uses task delegate_to instead of delegate vars to display delegate to host
- callbacks, restores missing delegate_vars
- correct doc links for become on warnings over world readable settings.
- correctly use world readable setting since old constant is not 'settable' anymore.
- facts - detect homebrew installed at /opt/homebrew/bin/brew
- filter plugins - patch new versions of Jinja2 to prevent warnings/errors on renamed filter decorators (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74667)
- get_url - Fixed checksum validation for binary files (leading asterisk) in checksum files (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74502).

v2.11.0
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2021-04-26
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html>`__


Major Changes
-------------

- A collection can be reinstalled with new version requirements without using the ``--force`` flag. The collection's dependencies will also be updated if necessary with the new requirements. Use ``--upgrade`` to force transitive dependency updates.
- AnsibleModule - use ``ArgumentSpecValidator`` class for validating argument spec and remove private methods related to argument spec validation. Any modules using private methods should now use the ``ArgumentSpecValidator`` class or the appropriate validation function.
- Declared ``resolvelib >= 0.5.3, < 0.6.0`` a direct dependency of
  ansible-core. Refs:
  - https://github.com/sarugaku/resolvelib
  - https://pypi.org/p/resolvelib
  - https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2020/03/27/pip-resolver-testing
- It became possible to install Ansible Collections from local folders and namespaces folder similar to SCM structure with multiple collections.
- It became possible to upgrade Ansible collections from Galaxy servers using the ``--upgrade`` option with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``.
- Support for role argument specification validation at role execution time. When a role contains an argument spec, an implicit validation task is inserted at the start of role execution.
- add ``ArgumentSpecValidator`` class for validating parameters against an argument spec outside of ``AnsibleModule`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73335)
- ansible-test - Tests run with the ``centos6`` and ``default`` test containers now use a PyPI proxy container to access PyPI when Python 2.6 is used. This allows tests running under Python 2.6 to continue functioning even though PyPI is discontinuing support for non-SNI capable clients.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add ``--format`` CLI option to ``ansible-galaxy collection list`` which allows for ``human`` (default), ``yaml``, or ``json``. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73474)
- Add an example for using var in with_sequence (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68836).
- Add new rolespec_validate option to the import/include_role modules do allow disabling of the implicit role arg validation task on a per-role basis.
- Add option to pass extra vars to ansible-inventory
- Add path of collection location in Ansible CLI version info.
- Add standard Python 2/3 compatibility boilerplate to setup script, module_utils and docs_fragments which were missing them.
- Add support for `argument_specs` data in role metadata.
- Add support for datetime.date object type in module result (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70583).
- Add which conditional is being evaluated at each step when debugging.
- Add yum/dnf version comparison documentation for package install
- Added NO_COLOR environment var to ansible color configuration, allowing it to integrate with existing convention.
- Added name of aliases in user error (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/58752).
- Added support for GSSAPI/Kerberos authentication with ``urls.py`` that is used by ``uri`` and ``get_url``.
- Added support for specify custom credentials for GSSAPI authentication.
- Allow an attribute to be passed to the min and max filters with Jinja 2.10+
- Allow for the skipped filter to be used on a registered looped task results. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/16949)
- Allow inventory plugins access to extra vars by default
- Allow unsafe_writes to be set on target via env var, for those targets that need a blanket setting.
- Also added extra vars cli option to console CLI.
- AnsiballZ - Improve performance of ``ModuleDepFinder`` by using faster lookups and reducing the object types that are walked while looking for ``import`` statements. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/70475)
- CLI - Specify jinja version in ``--version`` output
- CLI - Specify whether PyYAML includes libyaml support in version output
- CLI version displays clarified as core version
- Callbacks - Migrate more places in the ``TaskExecutor`` to sending callbacks directly over the queue, instead of sending them as ``TaskResult`` and short circuiting in the Strategy to send the callback. This enables closer to real time callbacks of retries and loop results (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73899)

- Collection routing: docker content from community.general migrated to community.docker (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73046).
- Controller - Add warning for Ansible 2.11 when running a Python version older than Python 3.8 to inform users that 2.12 will only support Python 3.8 and newer on the controller. Starting with Ansible 2.11, the project will only be packaged for Python 3.8 and newer.
- Discourage the use of 'hexdigits' in password lookup, as it distorts expected entropy.
- Enable extra vars for inventory plugin options

- Force the template module to use non-native Jinja2 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/46169)
- Internal config entries will not be documented, to mark an entry as internal it must start with `_`.
- Interpreter Discovery - Add Python 3.8 and Python 3.9 to the fallback list
- Minor code cleanup in plugin loader.
- Module API - libselinux-python is no longer required for basic module API selinux operations (affects core modules assemble, blockinfile, copy, cron, file, get_url, lineinfile, setup, replace, unarchive, uri, user, yum_repository)
- Module API - new module_respawn API allows modules that need to run under a specific Python interpreter to respawn in place under that interpreter

- TOML inventory plugin is no longer in preview status
- Templar - reduce the complexity of ``Templar._lookup`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73277)
- The ``csvfile`` lookup plugin now uses ``parse_kv()`` internally. As a result, multi-word search keys can now be passed.
- The ``csvfile`` lookup plugin's documentation has been fixed; it erroneously said that the delimiter could be ``t`` which was never true. We now accept ``\t``, however, and the error in the documentation has been fixed to note that.
- The constructed inventory plugin has new option to force using vars plugins on previouslly processed inventory sources.
- The find module is now more specific about the reasons it skips candidate files.
- The logging functionality in module_utils.basic now returns a nicer error when it falls back to syslog but ends up getting a TypeError thrown back.
- The new dependency resolver prefers ``MANIFEST.json`` over ``galaxy.yml`` if it exists in the target directory.
- The plugin loader now keeps track of the collection where a plugin was resolved to, in particular whether the plugin was loaded from ansible-core's internal paths (``ansible.builtin``) or from user-supplied paths (no collection name).
- Toggle allowing usage of extra_vars in compose
- When connecting as an unprivileged user, and becoming an unprivileged user, we now fall back to also trying ``chmod +a`` which works on macOS and makes use of ACLs.

- ansible-test - Generation of an ``egg-info`` directory, if needed, is now done after installing test dependencies and before running tests. When running from an installed version of ``ansible-test`` a temporary directory is used to avoid permissions issues. Previously it was done before installing test dependencies and adjacent to the installed directory.
- ansible-test - Implemented CloudStack test container selection by ENV variable `ANSIBLE_CLOUDSTACK_CONTAINER` with a default to `quay.io/ansible/cloudstack-test-container:1.4.0`.

- ansible-test - Refactor code for installing ``cryptography`` to allow re-use in the future.
- ansible-test - Refactor code to remove unused logic for obsolete support of multiple provisioning endpoints.
- ansible-test - Remove ``pytest < 6.0.0`` constraint for managed installations on Python 3.x now that pytest 6 is supported.

- ansible-test - add macOS 11.1 as a remote target (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72622)
- ansible-test - add the collection plugin directories ``plugin_utils`` and ``sub_plugins`` to list of plugin types. This ensures such plugins are tested for the ``import`` sanity test (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73599).
- ansible-test - centos6 end of life - container image updated to point to vault base repository (https://github.com/ansible/distro-test-containers/pull/54)
- ansible-test - centos6 image now has multiple fallback yum repositories for CentOS Vault.
- ansible-test - default container now uses default-test-container 2.7.0 and ansible-base-test-container 1.6.0. This brings in Python 3.9.0rc1 for testing.
- ansible-test - now makes a better attempt to support podman when calling ``docker images`` and asking for JSON format.
- ansible-test - python-cryptography is now bounded at <3.2, as 3.2 drops support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 upon which some of our CI infrastructure still depends.
- ansible-test - remote macOS instances no longer install ``virtualenv`` during provisioning
- ansible-test - the ACME test container was updated, it now supports external account creation and has a basic OCSP responder (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71097, https://github.com/ansible/acme-test-container/releases/tag/2.0.0).
- ansible-test - the ``import`` sanity test now also tries to import all non-module and non-module_utils Python files in ``lib/ansible/`` resp. ``plugins/`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72497).
- ansible-test - virtualenv helper scripts now prefer ``venv`` on Python 3 over ``virtualenv``
- ansible-test Now supports RHEL 8.3

- ansible-test validate-modules - option names that seem to indicate they contain secret information that should be marked ``no_log=True`` are now flagged in the validate-modules sanity test. False positives can be marked by explicitly setting ``no_log=False`` for these options in the argument spec. Please note that many false positives are expected; the assumption is that it is by far better to have false positives than false negatives (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73508).
- ansible-test validate-modules - validate removal version numbers (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71679).

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- Made SCM collections be reinstalled regardless of ``--force`` being present.
- NetBSD virtualization facts (specifically ``ansible_virtualization_type``) now returns a more accurate value by checking the value of the ``machdep.hypervisor`` ``sysctl`` key. This change is breaking because in some cases previously, we would erroneously report ``xen`` even when the target is not running on Xen. This prevents that behavior in most cases. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69352)
- Replaced the in-tree dependency resolver with an external implementation that pip >= 20.3 uses now by default — ``resolvelib``. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71784)
- The ``meta`` module now supports tags for user-defined tasks. Internal ``meta`` tasks continue to always run. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64558)
- ansible-galaxy login command has been removed (see https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71560)

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- Starting in 2.14, shell and command modules will no longer have the option to warn and suggest modules in lieu of commands. The ``warn`` parameter to these modules is now deprecated and defaults to ``False``. Similarly, the ``COMMAND_WARNINGS`` configuration option is also deprecated and defaults to ``False``. These will be removed and their presence will become an error in 2.14.
- apt_key - the paramater ``key`` does not have any effect, has been deprecated and will be removed in ansible-core version 2.14 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/70319).
- psrp - Set the minimum version of ``pypsrp`` to ``0.4.0``.

Removed Features (previously deprecated)
----------------------------------------

- Removed `SharedPluginLoaderObj` class from ansible.plugins.strategy. It was deprecated in favor of using the standard plugin loader.
- Removed `_get_item()` alias from callback plugin base class which had been deprecated in favor of `_get_item_label()`.
- The "user" parameter was previously deprecated and is now removed in favor of "scope"
- The deprecated ``ansible.constants.BECOME_METHODS`` has been removed.
- The deprecated ``ansible.constants.get_config()`` has been removed.
- The deprecated ``ansible.constants.mk_boolean()`` has been removed.
- `with_*` loops are no longer optimized for modules whose `name` parameters can take lists (mostly package managers). Use `name` instead of looping over individual names with `with_items` and friends.

Security Fixes
--------------

- **security issue** - Mask default and fallback values for ``no_log`` module options (CVE-2021-20228)
- **security issue** - copy - Redact the value of the no_log 'content' parameter in the result's invocation.module_args in check mode. Previously when used with check mode and with '-vvv', the module would not censor the content if a change would be made to the destination path. (CVE-2020-14332)
- Sanitize no_log values from any response keys that might be returned from the uri module (CVE-2020-14330).
- dnf - Previously, regardless of the ``disable_gpg_check`` option, packages were not GPG validated. They are now. (CVE-2020-14365)
