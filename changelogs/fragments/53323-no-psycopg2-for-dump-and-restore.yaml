bugfixes:
    - 'dump' and 'restore' state only need pg_dump and pg_restore. These tools
    don't use psycopg2 so this change tries to avoid the use of it in these
    cases. Fixes https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/35906
    - Replace the fix for https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/39412
    made in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39483 when using a compression
    program. This now uses a FIFO file to ensure failure detection of pg_dump.
    The Windows compatibility is completely dropped in this case.
