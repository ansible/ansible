major_changes:
  - ansible-test - Docker and Podman are now supported on hosts with cgroup v2 unified. 
                   Previously only cgroup v1 and cgroup v2 hybrid were supported.
  - ansible-test - Podman now works on container hosts without systemd.
                   Previously only some containers worked, while others required rootfull or rootless Podman,
                   but would not work with both. Some containers did not work at all.
  - ansible-test - When additional cgroup setup is required on the container host, this will be automatically detected.
                   Instructions on how to configure the host will be provided in the error message shown.
minor_changes:
  - ansible-test - When using Podman, ansible-test will detect if the loginuid used in containers is incorrect.
                   When this occurs a warning is displayed and the container is run with the AUDIT_CONTROL capability.
                   Previously containers would fail under this situation, with no useful warnings or errors given.
  - ansible-test - Failure to connect to a container over SSH now results in a clear error.
                   Previously tests would be attempted even after initial connection attempts failed.
  - ansible-test - Warnings are now shown when using containers that were built with VOLUME instructions.
  - ansible-test - Unit tests now support network disconnect by default when running under Podman.
                   Previously this feature only worked by default under Docker.
  - ansible-test - Additional log details are shown when containers fail to start or SSH connections to containers fail.
  - ansible-test - Containers included with ansible-test no longer disable seccomp by default.
  - ansible-test - A new ``cgroup`` option is available when running custom containers.
                   This option can be used to indicate a container requires cgroup v1 or that it does not use cgroup.
                   The default behavior assumes the container works with cgroup v2 (as well as v1).
  - ansible-test - A new ``audit`` option is available when running custom containers.
                   This option can be used to indicate a container requires the AUDIT_WRITE capability.
                   Containers with a patched OpenSSH requiring this capability will need this option when using Podman.
  - ansible-test - More details are provided about an instance when provisioning fails.
  - ansible-test - Connection failures to remote provisioned hosts now show failure details as a warning.
  - ansible-test - When setting the max open files for containers, the container host's limit will be checked.
                   If the host limit is lower than the preferred value, it will be used and a warning will be shown.
  - ansible-test - Use ``stop --time 0`` followed by ``rm`` to remove ephemeral containers instead of ``rm -f``.
                   This speeds up teardown of ephemeral containers.
  - ansible-test - Reduce the polling limit for SSHD startup in containers from 60 retries to 10.
                   The one second delay between retries remains in place.
bugfixes:
  - ansible-test - Multiple containers now work under podman without specifying the ``--docker-network`` option.
  - ansible-test - Prevent concurrent / repeat pulls of the same container image.
  - ansible-test - Prevent concurrent / repeat inspections of the same container image.
  - ansible-test - Prevent concurrent execution of cached methods.
  - ansible-test - Handle server errors when executing the ``docker info`` command.
  - ansible-test - Show the exception type when reporting errors during instance provisioning.
known_issues:
  - ansible-test - Using Docker on systems with SELinux may require setting SELinux to permissive mode.
                   Podman should work with SELinux in enforcing mode.
  - ansible-test - Containers may not work under WSL or WSL2.
