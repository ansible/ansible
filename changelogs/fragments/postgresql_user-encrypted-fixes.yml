minor_changes:
- "`postgresql_user` module changed `encrypted=yes` to be the default. This
   shouldn't break any current playbooks, the module will just store passwords
   hashed by default. This change was done because Postgres 10 dropped support for
   `UNENCRYPTED` passwords and because all versions since Postgres 7.2 support
   storing encrypted passwords."
