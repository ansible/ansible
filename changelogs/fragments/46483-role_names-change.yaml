minor_changes:
  - magic variables - added a new ``ansible_role_names`` magic variable to include the names of roles being applied to
    the host both directly and indirectly (via dependencies).
  - magic variabels - added a new ``ansible_play_role_names`` magic variable to mimic the old functionality of
    ``role_names``. This variable only lists the names of roles being applied to the host directly, and does not
    include those added via dependencies
  - magic variables - added a new ``ansible_dependent_role_names`` magic variable to contain the names of roles
    applied to the host indirectly, via dependencies.
deprecated_features:
  - magic variables - documented the deprecation of the ``role_names`` magic variable in favor of either
    ``ansible_role_names`` (including dependency role names) or ``ansible_play_role_names`` (excluding dependencies).
