minor_changes:
- "For Python modules, the behavior of ``required_by`` to treat an explicit value of ``none`` as 'not specified' is deprecated.
   From ansible-base 2.15 on, an explicit ``none`` will no longer be treated as 'not specified'. Then the behavior of ``required_by``
   will be the same as for all other ``required`` and ``required_*`` checks."

- "For Python modules, the checks for ``required``, ``required_if``, ``required_together``, ``required_one_of``, and ``required_by`` warn when an explicit ``none`` value is passed for them, but still accept that value.
   This behavior will be deprecated in ansible-base 2.12 and disabled in ansible-base 2.16.

   Module authors can explicitly request the old behavior (explicit ``none`` counts as specified) by setting ``allow_none_value=True`` in the argument spec for that option,
   and can explicitly request the new behavior  from ansible-base 2.16 (explicit ``none`` counts as error) by setting ``allow_none_value=False`` in the argument spec for that option
   (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69190)."
