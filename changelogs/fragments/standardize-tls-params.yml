  Modules and plugins have been standardized on a well-defined set of
  TLS-related parameters.  The old names remain as aliases for compatibility.
  In general, the new names will override the old names if both are specified.

  The standard names are:

  - ``client_cert``: certificate for client identity, might also include the private key
  - ``client_key``: private key for ``client_cert``
  - ``ca_cert``: public key to validate server's identity, usually a root certificate
  - ``validate_certs``: boolean to enable or disable certificate validity checking
