Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2024-10-14
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.18/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.18.html>`__

Minor Changes
-------------

- ansible-test - Default to Python 3.13 in the ``base`` and ``default`` containers.
- ansible-test - Disable the ``deprecated-`` prefixed ``pylint`` rules as their results vary by Python version.
- ansible-test - Improve container runtime probe error handling. When unexpected probe output is encountered, an error with more useful debugging information is provided.
- ansible-test - Update ``pylint`` sanity test to use version 3.3.1.
- ansible-test - Update the ``base`` and ``default`` containers.

Bugfixes
--------

- Errors now preserve stacked error messages even when YAML is involved.
- Fix disabling SSL verification when installing collections and roles from git repositories. If ``--ignore-certs`` isn't provided, the value for the ``GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS`` configuration option will be used (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83326).
- Improve performance on large inventories by reducing the number of implicit meta tasks.
- Use the requested error message in the ansible.module_utils.facts.timeout timeout function instead of hardcoding one.

- ansible-test - Enable the ``sys.unraisablehook`` work-around for the ``pylint`` sanity test on Python 3.11. Previously the work-around was only enabled for Python 3.12 and later. However, the same issue has been discovered on Python 3.11.
- debconf - set empty password values (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83214).
- dnf5 - fix traceback when ``enable_plugins``/``disable_plugins`` is used on ``python3-libdnf5`` versions that do not support this functionality
- facts - skip if distribution file path is directory, instead of raising error (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84006).

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- Stopped wrapping all commands sent over SSH on a Windows target with a ``powershell.exe`` executable. This results in one less process being started on each command for Windows to improve efficiency, simplify the code, and make ``raw`` an actual raw command run with the default shell configured on the Windows sshd settings. This should have no affect on most tasks except for ``raw`` which now is not guaranteed to always be running in a PowerShell shell and from having the console output codepage set to UTF-8. To avoid this issue either swap to using ``ansible.windows.win_command``, ``ansible.windows.win_shell``, ``ansible.windows.win_powershell`` or manually wrap the raw command with the shell commands needed to set the output console encoding.
- assert - Nested templating may result in an inability for the conditional to be evaluated. See the porting guide for more information.
- persistent connection plugins - The ``ANSIBLE_CONNECTION_PATH`` config option no longer has any effect.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- Deprecate ``ansible.module_utils.basic.AnsibleModule.safe_eval`` and ``ansible.module_utils.common.safe_eval`` as they are no longer used.
- persistent connection plugins - The ``ANSIBLE_CONNECTION_PATH`` config option no longer has any effect, and will be removed in a future release.
- yum_repository - deprecate ``async`` option as it has been removed in RHEL 8 and will be removed in ansible-core 2.22.
- yum_repository - the following options are deprecated: ``deltarpm_metadata_percentage``, ``gpgcakey``, ``http_caching``, ``keepalive``, ``metadata_expire_filter``, ``mirrorlist_expire``, ``protect``, ``ssl_check_cert_permissions``, ``ui_repoid_vars`` as they have no effect for dnf as an underlying package manager. The options will be removed in ansible-core 2.22.

Removed Features (previously deprecated)
----------------------------------------

- Play - removed deprecated ``ROLE_CACHE`` property in favor of ``role_cache``.
- Remove deprecated `VariableManager._get_delegated_vars` method (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82950)
- Removed Python 3.10 as a supported version on the controller. Python 3.11 or newer is required.
- Removed support for setting the ``vars`` keyword to lists of dictionaries. It is now required to be a single dictionary.
- loader - remove deprecated non-inclusive words (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82947).
- paramiko_ssh - removed deprecated ssh_args from the paramiko_ssh connection plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82939).
- paramiko_ssh - removed deprecated ssh_common_args from the paramiko_ssh connection plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82940).
- paramiko_ssh - removed deprecated ssh_extra_args from the paramiko_ssh connection plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82941).

Security Fixes
--------------

- templating - Address issues where internal templating can cause unsafe variables to lose their unsafe designation (CVE-2023-5764)

Bugfixes
--------

- -> runas become - Generate new token for the SYSTEM token to use for become. This should result in the full SYSTEM token being used and problems starting the process that fails with ``The process creation has been blocked``.
- Add a version ceiling constraint for pypsrp to avoid potential breaking changes in the 1.0.0 release.
- Add descriptions for ``ansible-galaxy install --help` and ``ansible-galaxy role|collection install --help``.
- Avoid truncating floats when casting into int, as it can lead to truncation and unexpected results. 0.99999 will be 0, not 1.
- COLOR_SKIP will not alter "included" events color display anymore.
- Callbacks now correctly get the resolved connection plugin name as the connection used.
- Darwin - add unit tests for Darwin hardware fact gathering.
- Fix ``SemanticVersion.parse()`` to store the version string so that ``__repr__`` reports it instead of ``None`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/83831).
- Fix a traceback when an environment variable contains certain special characters (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83498)
- Fix an issue when setting a plugin name from an unsafe source resulted in ``ValueError: unmarshallable object`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82708)
- Fix an issue where registered variable was not available for templating in ``loop_control.label`` on skipped looped tasks (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83619)
- Fix for ``meta`` tasks breaking host/fork affinity with ``host_pinned`` strategy (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83294)
- Fix handlers not being executed in lockstep using the linear strategy in some cases (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82307)
- Fix rapid memory usage growth when notifying handlers using the ``listen`` keyword (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83392)
- Fix the task attribute ``resolved_action`` to show the FQCN instead of ``None`` when ``action`` or ``local_action`` is used in the playbook.
- Fix using ``module_defaults`` with ``local_action``/``action`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81905).
- Fix using the current task's directory for looking up relative paths within roles (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82695).
- Remove deprecated config options DEFAULT_FACT_PATH, DEFAULT_GATHER_SUBSET, and DEFAULT_GATHER_TIMEOUT in favor of setting ``fact_path``, ``gather_subset`` and ``gather_timeout`` as ``module_defaults`` for ``ansible.builtin.setup``.
  These will apply to both the ``gather_facts`` play keyword, and any ``ansible.builtin.setup`` tasks.
  To configure these options only for the ``gather_facts`` keyword, set these options as play keywords also.
- Set LANGUAGE environment variable is set to a non-English locale (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83608).
- ``ansible-galaxy install --help`` - Fix the usage text and document that the requirements file passed to ``-r`` can include collections and roles.
- ``ansible-galaxy role install`` - update the default timeout to download archive URLs from 20 seconds to 60 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83521).
- ``end_host`` - fix incorrect return code when executing ``end_host`` in the ``rescue`` section (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83447)
- addressed issue of trailing text been ignored, non-ASCII characters are parsed, enhance white space handling and fixed overly permissive issue of human_to_bytes filter(https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82075)
- ansible-config will now properly template defaults before dumping them.
- ansible-doc - fixed "inicates" typo in output
- ansible-doc - format top-level descriptions with multiple paragraphs as multiple paragraphs, instead of concatenating them (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/83155).

- ansible-test - The ``pylint`` sanity test now includes the controller/target context of files when grouping them. This allows the ``--py-version`` option to be passed to ``pylint`` to indicate the minimum supported Python version for each test context, preventing ``pylint`` from defaulting to the Python version used to invoke the test.
- ansible-test action-plugin-docs - Fix to check for sidecar documentation for action plugins
- ansible_managed restored it's 'templatability' by ensuring the possible injection routes are cut off earlier in the process.

- apt_* - add more info messages raised while updating apt cache (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77941).
- assemble - update argument_spec with 'decrypt' option which is required by action plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80840).
- atomic_move - fix using the setgid bit on the parent directory when creating files (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/46742, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67177).
- config, restored the ability to set module compression via a variable
- connection plugins using the 'extras' option feature would need variables to match the plugin's loaded name, sometimes requiring fqcn, which is not the same as the documented/declared/expected variables. Now we fall back to the 'basename' of the fqcn, but plugin authors can still set the expected value directly.
- copy - mtime/atime not updated. Fix now update mtime/atime(https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83013)
- csvfile lookup - give an error when no search term is provided using modern config syntax (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83689).

- delay keyword is now a float, matching the underlying 'time' API and user expectations.
- display - warn user about empty log filepath (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79959).
- display now does a better job of mapping warnings/errors to the proper log severity when using ansible.log. We still use color as a fallback mapping (now prioritiezed by severity) but mostly rely on it beind directly set by warnning/errors calls.

- dnf, dnf5 - fix for installing a set of packages by specifying them using a wildcard character (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83373)
- dnf5 - re-introduce the ``state: installed`` alias to ``state: present`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83960)
- dnf5 - replace removed API calls
- ensure we have logger before we log when we have increased verbosity.
- facts - `support_discard` now returns `0` if either `discard_granularity` or `discard_max_hw_bytes` is zero; otherwise it returns the value of `discard_granularity`, as before (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/83480).
- facts - add a generic detection for VMware in product name.
- facts - add facts about x86_64 flags to detect microarchitecture (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83331).

- known_hosts - the returned module invocation now accurately reflects the module arguments.
- linear strategy now provides a properly templated task name to the v2_runner_on_started callback event.
- linear strategy: fix handlers included via ``include_tasks`` handler to be executed in lockstep (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83019)
- linux - remove extraneous get_bin_path API call.
- local - handle error while parsing values in ini files (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82717).
- lookup - Fixed examples of csv lookup plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83031).
- module_defaults - do not display action/module deprecation warnings when using an action_group that contains a deprecated plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83490).

- package_facts - no longer fails silently when the selected package manager is unable to list packages.
- package_facts - returns the correct warning when package listing fails.
- persistent connection plugins - The correct Ansible persistent connection helper is now always used. Previously, the wrong script could be used, depending on the value of the ``PATH`` environment variable. As a result, users were sometimes required to set ``ANSIBLE_CONNECTION_PATH`` to use the correct script.
- powershell - Implement more robust deletion mechanism for C# code compilation temporary files. This should avoid scenarios where the underlying temporary directory may be temporarily locked by antivirus tools or other IO problems. A failure to delete one of these temporary directories will result in a warning rather than an outright failure.
- powershell - Improve CLIXML decoding to decode all control characters and unicode characters that are encoded as surrogate pairs.

- service_facts - don't crash if OpenBSD rcctl variable contains '=' character (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83457)
- service_facts will now detect failed services more accurately across systemd implementations.
- setup module (fact gathering), added fallbcak code path to handle mount fact gathering in linux when threading is not available
- setup/gather_facts will skip missing ``sysctl`` instead of being a fatal error (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81297).
