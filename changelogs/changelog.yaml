  2.10.0b1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - ActionBase - Add new ``cleanup`` method that is explicitly run by the ``TaskExecutor``
        to ensure that the shell plugins ``tmpdir`` is always removed. This change
        means that individual action plugins need not be responsible for removing
        the temporary directory, which ensures that we don't have code paths that
        accidentally leave behind the temporary directory.
      - Add example setting for ``collections_paths`` parameter to ``examples/ansible.cfg``
      - Add missing gcp modules to gcp module defaults group
      - Added support for Flatcar Container Linux in distribution and hostname modules.
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/69627)
      - Added support for OSMC distro in hostname module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66189).
      - Allow tasks to notify a fqcn handler name (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68181)
      - An invalid value is hard to track down if you don't know where it came from,
        return field name instead.
      - Ansible.Basic - Fix issue when setting a ``no_log`` parameter to an empty
        string - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/62613
      - 'Ansible.ModuleUtils.WebRequest - actually set no proxy when ``use_proxy:
        no`` is set on a Windows module - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68528'
      - AnsibleDumper - Add a representer for AnsibleUnsafeBytes (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/62562).
      - 'AnsibleModule.run_command() - set ``close_fds`` to ``False`` on Python 2
        if ``pass_fds`` are passed to ``run_command()``. Since ``subprocess.Popen()``
        on Python 2 does not have the ``pass_fds`` option, there is no way to exclude
        a specific list of file descriptors from being closed.

        '
      - Avoid bare select() for running commands to avoid too large file descriptor
        numbers failing tasks
      - Avoid running subfunctions that are passed to show_vars function when it will
        be a noop.
      - By passing the module_tmpdir as a parameter in the write_ssh_wrapper function
        instead of initalizing module_tmpdir via get_module_path()
      - CLI - the `ANSIBLE_PLAYBOOK_DIR` envvar or `playbook_dir` config can now substitute
        for the --playbook-dir arg on CLIs that support it (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59464)
      - Check NoneType for raw_params before proceeding in include_vars (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64939).
      - Collections - Allow a collection role to call a stand alone role, without
        needing to explicitly add ``ansible.legacy`` to the collection search order
        within the collection role. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69101)
      - Correctly process raw_params in add_hosts.
      - Create an ``import_module`` compat util, for use across the codebase, to allow
        collection loading to work properly on Python26
      - DUPLICATE_YAML_DICT_KEY - Fix error output when configuration option DUPLICATE_YAML_DICT_KEY
        is set to error (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65366)
      - Do not keep empty blocks in PlayIterator after skipping tasks with tags.
      - Ensure DataLoader temp files are removed at appropriate times and that we
        observe the LOCAL_TMP setting.
      - Ensure that ``--version`` works with non-ascii ansible project paths (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66617)
      - Ensure that keywords defined as booleans are correctly interpreting their
        input, before patch any random string would be interpreted as False
      - Ensure we don't allow ansible_facts subkey of ansible_facts to override top
        level, also fix 'deprefixing' to prevent key transforms.
      - Fact Delegation - Add ability to indicate which facts must always be delegated.
        Primarily for ``discovered_interpreter_python`` right now, but extensible
        later. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/61002)
      - 'Fix a bug when a host was not removed from a play after ``meta: end_host``
        and as a result the host was still present in ``ansible_play_hosts`` and ``ansible_play_batch``
        variables.'
      - Fix an issue with the ``fileglob`` plugin where passing a subdirectory of
        non-existent directory would cause it to fail - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69450
      - Fix case sensitivity for ``lookup()`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66464)

        ./`` is set in the config
      - Fix issue with callbacks ``set_options`` method that was not called with collections
      - Fix label lookup in the default callback for includes (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65904)

      - Fix traceback when printing ``HostVars`` on native Jinja2 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65365)
      - Fixed a bug with the copy action plugin where mode=preserve was being passed
        on symlink files and causing a traceback (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68471).
      - Fixed the equality check for IncludedFiles to ensure they are not accidently
        merged when process_include_results runs.
      - Fixes in network action plugins load from collections using module prefix
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65071)
      - Force collection names to be static so that a warning is generated because
        templating currently does not work (see https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68704).
      - Handle empty extra vars in ansible cli (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/61497).
      - Handle empty roles and empty collections in requirements.yml in ansible-galaxy
        install command (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68186).
      - Handle exception encountered while parsing the argument description in module
        when invoked via ansible-doc command (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/60587).
      - Handle exception when /etc/shadow file is missing or not found, while operating
        user operation in user module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/63490).
      - HostVarsVars - Template the __repr__ value (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64128).
      - Make netconf plugin configurable to set ncclient device handler name in netconf
        plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/65718)
      - Make sure if a collection is supplied as a string that we transform it into
        a list.
      - Misc typo fixes in various documentation pages.
      - Module arguments in suboptions which were marked as deprecated with ``removed_in_version``
        did not result in a warning.
      - On HTTP status code 304, return status_code
      - Plugin Metadata is supposed to have default values.  When the metadata was
        missing entirely, we were properly setting the defaults.  Fixed the metadata
        parsing so that the defaults are also set when we were missing just a few
        fields.
      - Prevent a race condition when running handlers using a combination of the
        free strategy and include_role.
      - Prevent rewriting nested Block's data in filter_tagged_tasks
      - Prevent templating unused variables for {% include %} (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68699)

      - Remove a temp directory created by wait_for_connection action plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/62407).
      - Remove the unnecessary warning about aptitude not being installed (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/56832).
      - Remove unused Python imports in ``ansible-inventory``.
      - Role Installation - Ensure that a role containing files with non-ascii characters
        can be installed (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69133)
      - RoleRequirement - include stderr in the error message if a scm command fails
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/41336)
      - Skipping of become for ``network_cli`` connections now works when ``network_cli``
        is sourced from a collection.
      - Strictly check string datatype for 'tasks_from', 'vars_from', 'defaults_from',
        and 'handlers_from' in include_role (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68515).
      - Strip no log values from module response keys (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68400)
      - TaskQueueManager - Explicitly set the mutliprocessing start method to ``fork``
        to avoid issues with the default on macOS now being ``spawn``.
      - Templating - Ansible was caching results of Jinja2 expressions in some cases
        where these expressions could have dynamic results, like password generation
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/34144).
      - The ansible-galaxy publish command was using an incorrect URL for v3 servers.
        The configuration for v3 servers includes part of the path fragment that was
        added in the new test.
      - Update ActionBase._low_level_execute_command to honor executable (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68054)

        conditional not the value of the original conditional (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67735)
      - Use ``sys.exit`` instead of ``exit`` in ``ansible-inventory``.
      - Use fqcr from command module invocation using shell module. Fixes https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69788
      - Use hostnamectl command to get current hostname for host while using systemd
        strategy (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59438).
      - Using --start-at-task would fail when it attempted to skip over tasks with
        no name.
      - Validate include args in handlers.
      - Vault - Make the single vaulted value ``AnsibleVaultEncryptedUnicode`` class
        work more like a string by replicating the behavior of ``collections.UserString``
        from Python. These changes don't allow it to be considered a string, but most
        common python string actions will now work as expected. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/67823)
      - '``AnsibleUnsafe``/``AnsibleContext``/``Templar`` - Do not treat ``AnsibleUndefined``
        as being "unsafe" (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65198)'
      - account for empty strings in when splitting the host pattern (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/61964)
      - add parameter name to warning message when values are converted to strings
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/57145)
      - add_host action now correctly shows idempotency/changed status
      - added 'unimplemented' prefix to file based caching
      - added new option for default callback to compat variable to avoid old 3rd
        party plugins from erroring out.
      - adhoc CLI - when playbook-dir is specified and inside a collection, use default
        collection logic to resolve modules/actions
      - allow external collections to be created in the 'ansible' collection namespace
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59988)
      - also strip spaces around config values in pathlist as we do in list types
      - ansiballz - remove '' and '.' from sys.path to fix a permissions issue on
        OpenBSD with pipelining (#69320)

      - ansible-doc - Allow and give precedence to `removed_at_date` for deprecated
        modules.
      - ansible-doc now properly handles removed modules/plugins

      - ansible-galaxy - Utilize ``Templar`` for templating skeleton files, so that
        they have access to Ansible filters/tests/lookups (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69104)
      - 'ansible-galaxy - fix a bug where listing a specific role if it was not in
        the first path failed to find the role

        '
      - ansible-galaxy - fix regression that prenented roles from being listed
      - 'ansible-galaxy - hide warning during collection installation if other installed
        collections do not contain a ``MANIFEST.json`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67490)

        would be shown only for role subcommand (collection subcommand help is not
        shown). With this change, the entire help for ansible-galaxy (same as ansible-galaxy
        --help) is displayed along with the help for role subcommand. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69009)
      - ansible-inventory - Fix long standing bug not loading vars plugins for group
        vars relative to the playbook dir when the '--playbook-dir' and '--export'

        instances to remain compatible with an older pip install.
      - ansible-test - avoid use of deprecated junit_xml method
      - ansible-test - bump version of ACME test container. The new version includes
        updated dependencies.

        when the pip version in use is older than version 7.1
      - ansible-test change detection - Run only sanity tests on ``docs/`` and ``changelogs/``
        in collections, to avoid triggering full CI runs of integration and unit tests
        when files in these directories change.

        without a ``tests`` directory when using the ``--docker`` option.
      - ansible-test no longer optimizes setting ``PATH`` by prepending the directory

        an already installed version of Ansible.
      - ansible-test no longer tracebacks during change analysis due to processing
        an empty python file
      - ansible-test no longer tries to install ``coverage`` 5.0+ since those versions

        those versions are unsupported
      - ansible-test now correctly collects code coverage on the last task in a play.

        unit and integration tests instead of the requirements specified for Ansible's
        own unit and integration tests
      - ansible-test now correctly recognizes imports in collections when using the
        ``--changed`` option.
      - ansible-test now correctly rewrites coverage paths for PowerShell files when
        testing collections
      - ansible-test now creates its integration test temporary directory within the
        collection so ansible-playbook can properly detect the default collection
      - ansible-test now enables color ``ls`` on a remote host only if the host supports
        the feature
      - ansible-test now ignores empty ``*.py`` files when analyzing module_utils
        imports for change detection
      - ansible-test now ignores version control within subdirectories of collections.
        Previously this condition was an error.
      - ansible-test now ignores warnings when comparing pip versions before and after
        integration tests run
      - ansible-test now installs sanity test requirements specific to each test instead
        of installing requirements for all sanity tests
      - ansible-test now installs the correct version of ``cryptography`` with ``--requirements``
        or delegation when setuptools is older than version 18.5
      - ansible-test now limits Jinja2 installs to version 2.10 and earlier on Python
        2.6
      - ansible-test now limits ``pathspec`` to versions prior to 0.6.0 on Python
        2.6 to avoid installation errors
      - ansible-test now limits installation of ``hcloud`` to Python 2.7 and 3.5 -
        3.8 since other versions are unsupported
      - ansible-test now limits the version of ``setuptools`` on Python 2.6 to versions
        older than 37
      - ansible-test now loads the collection loader plugin early enough for ansible_collections
        imports to work in unit test conftest.py modules
      - ansible-test now preserves existing SSH authorized keys when provisioning
        a remote host
      - ansible-test now properly activates the vcenter plugin for vcenter tests when

        links were only visible when running from source)
      - ansible-test now shows the correct source path instead of ``%s`` for collection
        role based test targets when the ``-v`` option is used
      - ansible-test now supports submodules using older ``git`` versions which require
        querying status from the top level directory of the repo.
      - ansible-test now updates SSH keys it generates with newer versions of ssh-keygen
        to function with Paramiko
      - ansible-test now upgrades ``pip`` with `--requirements`` or delegation as

        setup and teardown of ``windows-integration`` tests and code coverage
      - ansible-test once again properly collects code coverage for ``ansible-connection``
      - ansible-test validate-modules - Fix arg spec collector for PowerShell to find
        utils in both a collection and base.
      - ansible-test validate-modules sanity test code ``missing-module-utils-import-c#-requirements``
        is now ``missing-module-utils-import-csharp-requirements`` (fixes ignore bug).
      - ansible-test validate-modules sanity test code ``multiple-c#-utils-per-requires``
        is now ``multiple-csharp-utils-per-requires`` (fixes ignore bug).
      - ansible-test validate-modules sanity test now checks for AnsibleModule initialization
        instead of module_utils imports, which did not work in many cases.
      - ansible-test validate-modules sanity test now properly handles collections
        imports using the Ansible collection loader.
      - ansible-test validate-modules sanity test now properly handles relative imports.

        default value of no but it's actually yes.
      - avoid fatal traceback when a bad FQCN for a callback is supplied in the whitelist
        (#69401).

        a non-existent collection is specified, or importing the plugin results in
        an exception (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66721)
      - combine filter - ``[dict1, [dict2]] | combine`` now raise an error; previously
        ``combine`` had an undocumented behaviour where it was flattening the list
        before combining it (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/57894#discussion_r339517518).

      - win_exec_wrapper - Be more defensive when it comes to getting unhandled exceptions
      - win_package - Handle quoted and unquoted strings in the registry ``UninstallString``
        value - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/40973
      - 'win_uri win_get_url - Fix the behaviour of ``follow_redirects: safe`` to

      deprecated_features:
      - Using the DefaultCallback without the correspodning doc_fragment or copying
        the documentation.
      - hash_behaviour - Deprecate ``hash_behaviour`` for future removal.
      - script inventory plugin - The 'cache' option is deprecated and will be removed
        in 2.12. Its use has been removed from the plugin since it has never had any
        effect.
      major_changes:
      - Both ansible-doc and ansible-console's help command will error for modules
        and plugins whose return documentation cannot be parsed as YAML. All modules
        and plugins passing ``ansible-test sanity --test yamllint`` will not be affected
        by this.
      - Collections may declare a list of supported/tested Ansible versions for the
        collection. A warning is issued if a collection does not support the Ansible
        version that loads it (can also be configured as silent or a fatal error).
        Collections that do not declare supported Ansible versions do not issue a
        warning/error.
      - Plugin routing allows collections to declare deprecation, redirection targets,
        and removals for all plugin types.
      - Plugins that import module_utils and other ansible namespaces that have moved
        to collections should continue to work unmodified.
      - Routing data built into Ansible 2.10 ensures that 2.9 content should work
        unmodified on 2.10. Formerly included modules and plugins that were moved
        to collections are still accessible by their original unqualified names, so
        long as their destination collections are installed.
      - When deprecations are done in code, they to specify a ``collection_name``
        so that deprecation warnings can mention which collection - or ansible-base
        - is deprecating a feature. This affects all ``Display.deprecated()`` or ``AnsibleModule.deprecate()``
        or ``Ansible.Basic.Deprecate()`` calls, and ``removed_in_version``/``removed_at_date``
        or ``deprecated_aliases`` in module argument specs.
      - ansible-test now uses a different ``default`` test container for Ansible Collections

      - Add a global toggle to control when vars plugins are executed (per task by
        default for backward compatibility or after importing inventory).
      - Add a new config parameter, WIN_ASYNC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT, which allows configuration
        of the named pipe connection timeout under Windows when launching async tasks.
      - Add a per-plugin stage option to override the global toggle to control the
        execution of individual vars plugins (per task, after inventory, or both).
      - Add an additional check for importing journal from systemd-python module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/60595).
      - Add new magic variable ``ansible_collection`` that contains the collection
        name
      - Add new magic variable ``ansible_role_name`` that contains the FQCN of the
        role

      - Added the ability to set ``DEFAULT_NO_TARGET_SYSLOG`` through the ``ansible_no_target_syslog``
        variable on a task
      - Ansible CLI fails with warning if extra_vars parameter is used with filename
        without @ sign (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/51857).
      - Ansible modules created with ``add_file_common_args=True`` added a number
        of undocumented arguments which were mostly there to ease implementing certain
        action plugins. The undocumented arguments ``src``, ``follow``, ``force``,
        ``content``, ``backup``, ``remote_src``, ``regexp``, ``delimiter``, and ``directory_mode``
        are now no longer added. Modules relying on these options to be added need
        to specify them by themselves. Also, action plugins relying on these extra
        elements in ``FILE_COMMON_ARGUMENTS`` need to be adjusted.
      - Ansible now allows deprecation by date instead of deprecation by version.
        This is possible for plugins and modules (``meta/runtime.yml`` and ``deprecated.removed_at_date``
        in ``DOCUMENTATION``, instead of ``deprecated.removed_in``), for plugin options
        (``deprecated.date`` instead of ``deprecated.version`` in ``DOCUMENTATION``),
        for module options (``removed_at_date`` instead of ``removed_in_version``
        in argument spec), and for module option aliases (``deprecated_aliases.date``
        instead of ``deprecated_aliases.version`` in argument spec).
      - Ansible should fail with error when non-existing limit file is provided in
        command line.
      - Ansible.Basic - Added the ability to specify multiple fragments to load in
        a generic way for modules that use a module_util with fragment options
      - Ansible.Basic.cs - Added support for ``deprecated_aliases`` to deprecated
        aliases in a standard way
      - Ansible.ModuleUtils.WebRequest - Move username and password aliases out of
        util to avoid option name collision
      - Change order of arguments in ansible cli to use --ask-vault-password and --vault-password-file
        by default
      - CollectionRequirement - Add a metadata property to update and retrieve the
        _metadata attribute.
      - Enable Ansible Collections loader to discover and import collections from
        ``site-packages`` dir and ``PYTHONPATH``-added locations.
      - Enable testing the AIX platform as a remote OS in ansible-test
      - Flatten the directory hierarchy of modules
      - Ignore plesk-release file while parsing distribution release (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64101).
      - Openstack inventory script is migrated to ansible-openstack-collection, adjusted
        the link in documentation accordingly.
      - Openstack inventory script is moved to openstack.cloud from community.general.
      - PowerShell Add-Type - Add an easier way to reference extra types when compiling
        C# code on PowerShell Core
      - PowerShell Add-Type - Added the ``X86`` and ``AMD64`` preprocessor symbols
        for conditional compiling
      - Prevent losing useful error information by including both the loop and the
        conditional error messages (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66529)
      - Provides additional information about collection namespace name restrictions
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65151).
      - Raise error when no task file is provided to import_tasks (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/54095).
      - Refactor test_distribution_version testcases.
      - Remove the deprecation message for the ``TRANSFORM_INVALID_GROUP_CHARS`` setting.
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/61889)
      - Removed extras_require support from setup.py (and [azure] extra). Requirements
        will float with the collections, so it's not appropriate for ansible-base
        to host requirements for them any longer.
      - Simplify dict2items filter example in loop documentation (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65505).
      - Templating - Add globals to the jinja2 environment at ``Templar`` instantiation,
        instead of customizing the template object. Only customize the template object,
        to disable lookups. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/69278)
      - Templating - Add support to auto unroll generators produced by jinja2 filters,
        to prevent the need of explicit use of ``|list`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/68014)
      - The results queue and counter for results are now split for standard / handler
        results. This allows the governing strategy to be truly independent from the
        handler strategy, which basically follows the linear methodology.
      - Update required library message with correct grammer in basic.py.
      - Updated inventory script location for EC2, Openstack, and Cobbler after collection
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68897).
      - Updated inventory script location for infoblox, ec2 and other after collection
        migration (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69139).
      - Updates ``ansible_role_names``, ``ansible_play_role_names``, and ``ansible_dependent_role_names``
        to include the FQCN
      - Use OrderedDict by default when importing mappings from YAML.
      - Windows - Add a check for the minimum PowerShell version so we can create
        a friendly error message on older hosts
      - Windows - add deprecation notice in the Windows setup module when running
        on Server 2008, 2008 R2, and Windows 7
      - '`AnsibleModule.fail_json()` has always required that a message be passed
        in which informs the end user why the module failed.  In the past this message
        had to be passed as the `msg` keyword argument but it can now be passed as
        the first positional argument instead.'
      - '``AnsibleModule.load_file_common_arguments`` now allows to simply override
        ``path``.'
      - add mechanism for storing warnings and deprecations globally and not attached
        to an ``AnsibleModule`` object (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/58993)
      - added more ways to configure new uri options in 2.10.
      - ansible-doc - improve suboptions formatting (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/69795).
      - ansible-doc - now indicates if an option is added by a doc fragment from another
        collection by prepending the collection name, or ``ansible.builtin`` for ansible-base,
        to the version number.
      - ansible-doc - return values will be properly formatted (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/69796).
      - ansible-galaxy - Add ``download`` option for ``ansible-galaxy collection``
        to download collections and their dependencies for an offline install
      - ansible-galaxy - Add a `verify` subcommand to `ansible-galaxy collection`.
        The collection found on the galaxy server is downloaded to a tempfile to compare
        the checksums of the files listed in the MANIFEST.json and the FILES.json
        with the contents of the installed collection.
      - ansible-galaxy - Added the ability to display the progress wheel through the
        C.GALAXY_DISPLAY_PROGRESS config option. Also this now defaults to displaying
        the progress wheel if stdout has a tty.
      - ansible-galaxy - Added the ability to ignore further files and folders using
        a pattern with the ``build_ignore`` key in a collection's ``galaxy.yml`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59228).
      - ansible-galaxy - Allow installing collections from git repositories.
      - ansible-galaxy - Always ignore the ``tests/output`` directory when building
        a collection as it is used by ``ansible-test`` for test output (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59228).

        in a requirements file but can't be installed together.
      - ansible-galaxy - Install both collections and roles with ``ansible-galaxy
        install -r requirements.yml`` in certain scenarios.
      - ansible-galaxy - Requirement entries for collections now support a 'type'
        key to indicate whether the collection is a galaxy artifact, file, url, or
        git repo.
      - ansible-galaxy - add ``--token`` argument which is the same as ``--api-key``
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65955)

      - ansible-test - ``validate-modules`` now also accepts an ISO 8601 formatted
        date as ``deprecated.removed_at_date``, instead of requiring a version number
        in ``deprecated.removed_in``.
      - ansible-test - ``validate-modules`` now makes sure that module documentation
        deprecation removal version and/or date matches with removal version and/or
        date in meta/runtime.yml.
      - ansible-test - ``validate-modules`` now validates all version numbers in documentation
        and argument spec. Version numbers for collections are checked for being valid
        semantic versioning version number strings.
      - ansible-test - add ``validate-modules`` tests for ``removed_in_version`` and
        ``deprecated_aliases`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/66920/).
      - ansible-test - add check for ``print()`` calls in modules and module_utils.
      - ansible-test - added a ``--no-pip-check`` option

        ``--disable-httptester`` and `--no-temp-unicode`` options
      - ansible-test - allow sanity tests to check for optional errors by specifying
        ``--enable-optional-errors`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/66920/).
      - ansible-test - also run the ``ansible-doc`` sanity test with ``--json`` to

        as JSON (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69238).
      - ansible-test - enable deprecated version testing for modules and ``module.deprecate()``
        calls (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/66920/).
      - ansible-test - extend alias validation.
      - ansible-test - fixed ``units`` command with ``--docker`` to (mostly) work
        under podman
      - ansible-test - improve module validation so that ``default``, ``sample`` and
        ``example`` contain JSON values and not arbitrary YAML values, like ``datetime``
        objects or dictionaries with non-string keys.
      - ansible-test - module validation will now consider arguments added by ``add_file_common_arguments=True``
        correctly.
      - ansible-test - switch from testing RHEL 8.0 and RHEL 8.1 Beta to RHEL 8.1
      - ansible-test - the argument spec of modules is now validated by a YAML schema.
      - ansible-test - the module validation code now checks whether ``elements``
        documentation for options matches the argument_spec.
      - ansible-test - the module validation code now checks whether ``elements``
        is defined when ``type=list``
      - ansible-test - the module validation code now checks whether ``requirement``
        for options is documented correctly.
      - ansible-test add pyparsing constraint for Python 2.x to avoid compatibility
        issues with the upcoming pyparsing 3 release
      - ansible-test defaults to redacting sensitive values (disable with the ``--no-redact``
        option)
      - ansible-test has been updated to use ``default-test-container:1.13`` which
        includes fewer Python requirements now that most modules and tests have been
        migrated to collections.
      - ansible-test no longer detects ``git`` submodule directories as files.
      - ansible-test no longer provides a ``--tox`` option. Use the ``--venv`` option
        instead. This only affects testing the Ansible source. The feature was never
        available for Ansible Collections or when running from an Ansible install.
      - ansible-test no longer tries to install sanity test dependencies on unsupported
        Python versions
      - ansible-test now checks for the minimum and maximum supported versions when
        importing ``coverage``
      - ansible-test now filters out unnecessary warnings and messages from pip when
        installing its own requirements

        command.
      - ansible-test now includes the ``pylint`` plugin ``mccabe`` in optional sanity
        tests enabled with ``--enable-optional-errors``

        created by ``coverage`` version 5 or later
      - ansible-test now supports provisioning of network resources when testing network
        collections
      - ansible-test now supports skip aliases in the format ``skip/{arch}/{platform}``
        and ``skip/{arch}/{platform}/{version}`` where ``arch`` can be ``power``.
        These aliases are only effective for the ``--remote`` option.
      - ansible-test now supports skip aliases in the format ``skip/{platform}/{version}``
        for the ``--remote`` option. This is preferred over the older ``skip/{platform}{version}``
        format which included no ``/`` between the platform and version.
      - ansible-test now supports testing against RHEL 7.8 when using the ``--remote``
        option.
      - ansible-test now supports the ``--remote power/centos/7`` platform option.
      - ansible-test now validates the schema of ansible_builtin_runtime.yml and a
        collections meta/runtime.yml file.
      - ansible-test provides clearer error messages when failing to detect the provider
        to use with the ``--remote`` option.
      - ansible-test provisioning of network devices for ``network-integration`` has
        been updated to use collections.
      - ansible_native_concat() - use ``to_text`` function rather than Jinja2's ``text_type``
        which has been removed in Jinja2 master branch.
      - apt - Implemented an exponential backoff behaviour when retrying to update
        the cache with new params ``update_cache_retry_max_delay`` and ``update_cache_retries``
        to control the behavior.
      - apt_repository - Implemented an exponential backoff behaviour when retrying
        to update the apt cache with new params ``update_cache_retry_max_delay`` and
        ``update_cache_retries`` to control the behavior.
      - blockinfile - Update module documentation to clarify insertbefore/insertafter
        usage.
      - callbacks - Allow modules to return `None` as before/after entries for diff.
        This should make it easier for modules to report the "not existing" state
        of the entity they touched.
      - combine filter - now accept a ``list_merge`` argument which modifies its behaviour
        when the hashes to merge contain arrays/lists.

        be added to head of sys.path at ansible package load
      - file - specifying ``src`` without ``state`` is now an error
      - get_bin_path() - change the interface to always raise ``ValueError`` if the
        command is not found (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/56813)
      - get_url - Remove deprecated string format support for the headers option (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/61891)
      - git - added an ``archive_prefix`` option to set a prefix to add to each file
        path in archive
      - host_group_vars plugin - Require whitelisting and whitelist by default.
      - new magic variable - ``ansible_config_file`` - full path of used Ansible config
        file
      - package_facts.py - Add support for Pacman package manager.
      - plugin loader - Add MODULE_IGNORE_EXTS config option to skip over certain

      - 'rename ``_find_existing_collections()`` to ``find_existing_collections()``
        to reflect its use across multiple files

        '
      - reorganized code for the ``ansible-test coverage`` command for easier maintenance
        and feature additions
      - service_facts - Added undocumented 'indirect' and 'static' as service status
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69752).
      - ssh - connection plugin now supports a new variable ``sshpass_prompt`` which
        gets passed to ``sshpass`` allowing the user to set a custom substring to
        search for a password prompt (requires sshpass 1.06+)
      - systemd - default scope is now explicitly "system"
      - tests - Add new ``truthy`` and ``falsy`` jinja2 tests to evaluate the truthiness
        or falsiness of a value
      - to_nice_json filter - Removed now-useless exception handler
      - to_uuid - add a named parameter to let the user optionally set a custom namespace

      - '**security issue** - Update ``AnsibleUnsafeText`` and ``AnsibleUnsafeBytes``
        to maintain unsafe context by overriding ``.encode`` and ``.decode``. This
        prevents future issues with ``to_text``, ``to_bytes``, or ``to_native`` removing
        the unsafe wrapper when converting between string types (CVE-2019-14856)

      - '**security issue** - properly hide parameters marked with ``no_log`` in suboptions
        when invalid parameters are passed to the module (CVE-2019-14858)'
      - '**security issue** win_unzip - normalize paths in archive to ensure extracted
        files do not escape from the target directory (CVE-2020-1737)

      - 'Command module: Removed suggestions to use modules which have moved to collections
        and out of ansible-base'
      - The plugin loader now keeps track of the collection where a plugin was resolved

      - TOML inventory - Ensure we register dump functions for ``AnsibleUnsafe`` to
        support dumping unsafe values. Note that the TOML format has no functionality

      - ansible-test - Remove ``pytest < 6.0.0`` constraint for managed installations
        on Python 3.x now that pytest 6 is supported.
      - ansible-test - the ACME test container was updated, it now supports external
        account creation and has a basic OCSP responder (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71097,

      - 'dnf - it is now possible to specify both ``security: true`` and ``bugfix:

        as a string (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71609)
      - powershell - remove getting the PowerShell version from the env var ``POWERSHELL_VERSION``.
        This feature never worked properly and can cause conflicts with other libraries
        that use this var

        ``.rst``, ``.toml``, ``.txt`` in the collection root directory (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72353).
      - ansible-test validate-modules - when a module uses ``add_file_common_args=True``
        and does not use a keyword argument for ``argument_spec`` in ``AnsibleModule()``,
        the common file arguments were not considered added during validation (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72334).
      - basic.AnsibleModule - AnsibleModule.run_command silently ignores a non-existent
        directory in the ``cwd`` argument (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72390).

        information is currently only available in the text view (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72359).
      - 'ansible-galaxy - find any collection dependencies in the globally configured
        Galaxy servers and not just the server the parent collection is from.

        '

        options is ``false``, as the default is ``none`` and for some modules, ``none``
        and ``false`` mean different things (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69561).
      - iptables - reorder comment postition to be at the end (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71444).

      - Fix bytestring vs string comparison in module_utils.basic.is_special_selinux_path()
        so that special-cased filesystems which don't support SELinux context attributes
        still allow files to be manipulated on them. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70244)
      - 'Fix notifying handlers via `role_name : handler_name` when handler name contains
        the role name. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70582)'

      - paramiko connection plugin - Ensure we only reset the connection when one
        has been previously established (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65812)

      - ansible-test - add macOS 11.1 as a remote target (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72622)
      - ansible-test - remote macOS instances no longer install ``virtualenv`` during
        provisioning

      bugfixes:
      - Added unsafe_writes test.
      - Always mention the name of the deprecated or tombstoned plugin in routing
        deprecation/tombstone messages (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73059).
      - Correct the inventory source error parse handling, specifically make the config
        INVENTORY_ANY_UNPARSED_IS_FAILED work as expected.
      - Enabled unsafe_writes for get_url which was ignoring the paramter.
      - Fix incorrect variable scoping when using ``import with context`` in Jinja2
        templates. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/72615)
      - Restored unsafe_writes functionality which was being skipped.
      - allow become method 'su' to work on 'local' connection by allocating a fake
        tty.
      - ansble-test - only require a collection name in deprecation warnings when
        necessary (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72987)
      - ansible-test - Temporarily limit ``cryptography`` to versions before 3.4 to
        enable tests to function.
      - ansible-test - The ``--remote`` option has been updated for Python 2.7 to
        work around breaking changes in the newly released ``get-pip.py`` bootstrapper.
      - ansible-test - The ``--remote`` option has been updated to use a versioned
        ``get-pip.py`` bootstrapper to avoid issues with future releases.
      - ansible-test sanity changelog test - bump dependency on antsibull-changelog
        to 0.9.0 so that `fragments that add new plugins or objects <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/blob/main/docs/changelogs.rst#adding-new-roles-playbooks-test-and-filter-plugins>`_
        will not fail validation (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73428).
      - display correct error information when an error exists in the last line of
        the file (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/16456)
      - facts - properly report virtualization facts for Linux guests running on bhyve
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73167)
      - git - Only pass ``--raw`` flag to git verify commands (verify-tag, verify-commit)
        when ``gpg_whitelist`` is in use. Otherwise don't pass it so that non-whitelist
        GPG validation still works on older Git versions. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64469)
      - import_playbook - change warning about extra parameters to deprecation (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/72745)
      - pause - do not warn when running in the background if a timeout is provided
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73042)

        in case ``stdout`` is bytes.
      - validate-modules - do not raise an ``AttributeError`` if a value is assigned
        to a module attribute in a try/except block.
      minor_changes:
      - ansible-test - Added Ubuntu 20.04 LTS image to the default completion list

      - InventoryManager - Fix unhandled exception when given limit file was actually
        a directory.
      - InventoryManager - Fix unhandled exception when inventory directory was empty
        or contained empty subdirectories (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73658).
      - add AlmaLinux to fact gathering (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73458)
      - ansible-galaxy - fixed galaxy role init command (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71977).
      - ansible-inventory CLI - Deal with failures when sorting JSON and you have
        incompatible key types (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68950).
      - ansible-test - Running tests using an installed version of ``ansible-test``
        against one Python version from another no longer fails due to a missing ``egg-info``
        directory. This could occur when testing plugins which import ``pkg_resources``.
      - ansible-test - Running tests using an installed version of ``ansible-test``
        no longer generates an error attempting to create an ``egg-info`` directory
        when an existing one is not found in the expected location. This could occur
        if the existing ``egg-info`` directory included a Python version specifier
        in the name.
      - default callback - Ensure that the ``host_pinned`` strategy is not treated
        as lockstep (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73364)
      - ensure find_mount_point consistently returns text.
      - ensure we don't clobber role vars data when getting an empty file
      - find module - Stop traversing directories past the requested depth. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73627)
      - hostname - add Almalinux support (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73619)
      - runtime routing - redirect ``firewalld`` to ``ansible.posix.firewalld`` FQCN
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73689).
      - the unvault lookup plugin returned a byte string. Now returns a real string.
      - yamllint - do not raise an ``AttributeError`` if a value is assigned to a
        module attribute at the top of the module.
      minor_changes:
      - ansible-test - Generation of an ``egg-info`` directory, if needed, is now
        done after installing test dependencies and before running tests. When running
        from an installed version of ``ansible-test`` a temporary directory is used
        to avoid permissions issues. Previously it was done before installing test
        dependencies and adjacent to the installed directory.
      - ansible-test - now makes a better attempt to support podman when calling ``docker
        images`` and asking for JSON format.

      bugfixes:
      - Fix adding unrelated candidate names to the plugin loader redirect list.
      - Strategy - When building the task in the Strategy from the Worker, ensure
        it is properly marked as finalized and squashed. Addresses an issue with ``ansible_failed_task``.
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/57399)
      - ansible-test - The ``--export`` option for ``ansible-test coverage`` is now
        limited to the ``combine`` command. It was previously available for reporting
        commands on which it had no effect.
      - ansible-test - The ``ansible-test coverage combine`` option ``--export`` now
        exports relative paths. This avoids loss of coverage data when aggregating
        across systems with different absolute paths. Paths will be converted back
        to absolute when generating reports.
      - ansible-test - ensure unit test paths for connection and inventory plugins
        are correctly identified for collections (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73876).

      - debug action - prevent setting facts when displaying ansible_facts (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74060).
      - find - fix default pattern when use_regex is true (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/50067).
      - restrict module valid JSON parsed output to objects as lists are not valid
        responses.
      - setup - fix error handling on bad subset given.
      - setup, don't give up on all local facts gathering if one script file fails.
      - su become plugin - ensure correct type for localization option (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73837).
      minor_changes:
      - module payload builder - module_utils imports in any nested block (eg, ``try``,
        ``if``) are treated as optional during module payload builds; this allows
        modules to implement runtime fallback behavior for module_utils that do not
        exist in older versions of Ansible.

    release_date: '2021-05-03'
  2.10.9rc1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Prevent ``ansible_failed_task`` from further templating (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74036)
      - ansible-test - Avoid publishing the port used by the ``pypi-test-container``
        since it is only accessed by other containers. This avoids issues when trying
        to run tests in parallel on a single host.
      - ansible-test - Fix docker container IP address detection. The ``bridge`` network
        is no longer assumed to be the default.
      - ansible-test - ensure the correct unit test target is given when the ``__init__.py``
        file is modified inside the connection plugins directory
      - ansible.utils.encrypt now handles missing or unusable 'crypt' library.
      - facts - detect homebrew installed at /opt/homebrew/bin/brew
      - interpreter discovery - Debian 8 and lower will avoid unsupported Python3
        version in interpreter discovery
      - undeprecate hash_merge setting and add more docs clarifying its use and why
        not to use it.
      - wait_for module, move missing socket into function to get proper comparrison
        in time.
      major_changes:
      - ansible-test - Tests run with the ``centos6`` and ``default`` test containers
        now use a PyPI proxy container to access PyPI when Python 2.6 is used. This
        allows tests running under Python 2.6 to continue functioning even though
        PyPI is discontinuing support for non-SNI capable clients.
      minor_changes:
      - Switch to hashlib.sha256() for ansible-test to allow for FIPs mode.
