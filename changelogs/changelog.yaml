      - Add a YAML representer for ``NativeJinjaUnsafeText``
      - AnsiballZ - Ensure we use the full python package in the module cache filename
        to avoid a case where ``collections:`` is used to execute a module via short
        name, where the short name duplicates another module from ``ansible.builtin``
        or another collection that was executed previously.

      - Ensure the correct ``environment_class`` is set on ``AnsibleJ2Template``
      - Fix ``AttributeError`` when providing password file via ``--connection-password-file``
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76530)

      - Templating - Ensure we catch exceptions when getting ``.filters`` and ``.tests``
        attributes on their respective plugins and properly error, instead of aborting
        which results in no filters being added to the jinja2 environment
      - Trigger an undefined error when an undefined variable is detected within a
        dictionary and/or list (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/75587)
      - _run_loop - Add the task name to the warning (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76011)

        configuration options
      - ansible-galaxy - Fix using the '--ignore-certs' option when there is no server-specific
        configuration for the Galaxy server.
      - ansible-galaxy - installing/downloading collections with invalid versions
        in git repositories and directories now gives a formatted error message (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76425,
        https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75404).
      - ansible-galaxy - when installing a role properly raise an error when inaccessible
        path is specified multiple times in roles_path (e.g. via environment variable
        and command line option) (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76316)
      - ansible-galaxy collection build - Ignore any existing ``MANIFEST.json`` and
        ``FILES.json`` in the root directory when building a collection.

        versions.
      - ansible-test - All virtual environments managed by ansible-test are marked
        as usable after being bootstrapped, to avoid errors caused by use of incomplete
        environments. Previously this was only done for sanity tests. Existing environments
        from previous versions of ansible-test will be recreated on demand due to
        lacking the new marker.
      - ansible-test - Automatic target requirements installation is now based on
        the target environment instead of the controller environment.
      - ansible-test - Correctly detect when running as the ``root`` user (UID 0)
        on the origin host. The result of the detection was incorrectly being inverted.
      - ansible-test - Don't fail if network cannot be disconnected (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77472)
      - ansible-test - Fix Python real prefix detection when running in a ``venv``
        virtual environment.

      - ansible-test - Fix the ``import`` sanity test to work properly when Ansible's
        built-in vendoring support is in use.
      - ansible-test - Fix the ``validate-modules`` sanity test to avoid double-loading
        the collection loader and possibly failing on import of the ``packaging``
        module.
      - ansible-test - Fix traceback in ``import`` sanity test on Python 2.7 when
        ``pip`` is not available.
      - ansible-test - Fix traceback in the ``validate-modules`` sanity test when
        testing an Ansible module without any callables.
      - ansible-test - Fix traceback when running from an install and delegating execution
        to a different Python interpreter.
      - ansible-test - Fix traceback when using the ``--all`` option with PowerShell
        code coverage.
      - ansible-test - Fix type hints.
      - ansible-test - Import ``yaml.cyaml.CParser`` instead of ``_yaml.CParser``
        in the ``yamllint`` sanity test.
      - ansible-test - Limit ``paramiko`` installation to versions before 2.9.0. This
        is required to maintain support for systems which do not support RSA SHA-2
        algorithms.
      - ansible-test - Pylint Deprecated Plugin - Use correct message symbols when
        date or version is not a float or str (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77085)
      - ansible-test - Relocate constants to eliminate symlink.
      - ansible-test - Replace the directory portion of out-of-tree paths in JUnit
        files from integration tests with the ``out-of-tree:`` prefix.
      - ansible-test - Sanity tests run with the ``--requirements` option for Python
        2.x now install ``virtualenv`` when it is missing or too old. Previously it
        was only installed if missing. Version 16.7.12 is now installed instead of
        the latest version.
      - ansible-test - Set the ``pytest`` option ``--rootdir`` instead of letting
        it be auto-detected.
      - ansible-test - Show an error message instead of a traceback when running outside
        of a supported directory.
      - ansible-test - Target integration test requirements are now correctly installed
        for target environments running on the controller.
      - ansible-test - The ``import`` sanity test no longer reports errors about ``packaging``
        being missing when testing collections.
      - ansible-test - Update distribution test containers to version 3.1.0.
      - ansible-test - Update help links to reference ``ansible-core`` instead of
        ``ansible``.
      - ansible-test - Update unit tests to use the ``--forked`` option instead of
        the deprecated ``--boxed`` option.
      - ansible-test - Use https://ci-files.testing.ansible.com/ for instance bootstrapping
        instead of an S3 endpoint.
      - ansible-test - Use relative paths in JUnit files generated during integration
        test runs.
      - ansible-test - Use the correct variable to reference the client's SSH key
        when generating inventory.
      - ansible-test - Use the legacy collection loader for ``import`` sanity tests
        on target-only Python versions.
      - ansible-test - Virtual environments managed by ansible-test now use consistent
        versions of ``pip``, ``setuptools`` and ``wheel``. This avoids issues with
        virtual environments containing outdated or dysfunctional versions of these
        tools. The initial bootstrapping of ``pip`` is done by ansible-test from an
        HTTPS endpoint instead of creating the virtual environment with it already
        present.
      - ansible-test - fix a typo in validate-modules.
      - ansible-test - fixed support container failures (eg http-test-container) under
        podman
      - ansible-test compile sanity test - do not crash if a column could not be determined
        for an error (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77465).
      - ansible-test pslint - Fix error when encountering validation results that
        are highly nested - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74151
      - ansible-vault encrypt_string - fix ``--output`` option to correctly write
        encrypted string into given file (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75101)
      - ansible.builtin.file modification_time supports check_mode
      - ansible_facts.devices - Fix parsing of device serial number detected via sg_inq
        for rhel8 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75420)
      - apt - fails to deploy deb file to old debian systems using python-apt < 0.8.9
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/47277)
      - async - Improve performance of sending async callback events by never sending
        the full task through the queue (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76729)
      - catch the case that cowsay is broken which would lead to missing output
      - cleaning facts will now only warn about the variable name and not post the
        content, which can be undesireable to disclose
      - collection_loader - Implement 'find_spec' and 'exec_module' to override deprecated
        importlib methods 'find_module' and 'load_module' when applicable (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74660).
      - correctly inherit vars from parent in block (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75286).
      - default callback - Ensure we compare FQCN also in lockstep logic, to ensure
        using the FQCN of a strategy plugin triggers the correct behavior in the default
        callback plugin. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76782)
      - distribution - add EuroLinux to fact gathering (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/76624).
      - distribution - detect tencentos and gather correct facts on the distro.
      - dnf - ensure releasever is passed into libdnf as string (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77010)
      - extend timeout for ansible-galaxy when communicating with the galaxy server
        api, and apply it to all interactions with the api
      - facts - add support for deepin distro information detection (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77286).
      - first_found - fix to allow for spaces in file names (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77136)
      - gather_facts - Fact gathering now continues even if it fails to read a file
      - gather_facts action now handles the move of base connection plugin types into
        collections to add/prevent subset argument correctly
      - gather_facts/setup will not fail anymore if capsh is present but not executable
      - git module fix docs and proper use of ssh wrapper script and GIT_SSH_COMMAND
        depending on version.
      - git module is more consistent and clearer about which ssh options are added
        to git calls.
      - git module no longer uses wrapper script for ssh options.
      - hacking - fix incorrect usage of deprecated fish-shell redirection operators
        that failed to honor ``--quiet`` flag when sourced (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77180).
      - hostname - Do not require SystemdStrategy subclasses for every distro (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76792)
      - hostname - Fix Debian strategy KeyError, use `SystemdStrategy` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76124)
      - hostname - Update the systemd strategy in the ``hostname`` module to not interfere
        with NetworkManager (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76958)
      - hostname - add hostname support for openEuler distro (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/76619).
      - hostname - use ``file_get_content()`` to read the file containing the host
        name in the ``FileStrategy.get_permanent_hostname()`` method. This prevents
        a ``TypeError`` from being raised when the strategy is used (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77025).
      - include_vars, properly initialize variable as there is corner case in which
        it can end up referenced and not defined
      - inventory - parameterize ``disable_lookups`` in ``Constructable`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76769).
      - inventory manager now respects --flush-cache
      - junit callback - Fix traceback during automatic fact gathering when using
        relative paths.
      - junit callback - Fix unicode error when handling non-ASCII task paths.
      - module_utils.common.yaml - The ``SafeLoader``, ``SafeDumper`` and ``Parser``
        classes now fallback to ``object`` when ``yaml`` is not available. This fixes
        tracebacks when inheriting from these classes without requiring a ``HAS_YAML``
        guard around class definitions.
      - parameters - handle blank values when argument is a list (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77108).
      - play_context now compensates for when a conneciton sets the default to inventory_hostname
        but skips adding it to the vars.
      - playbook/strategy have more informative 'attribute' based errors for playbook
        objects and handlers.
      - python modules (new type) will now again prefer the specific python stated
        in the module's shebang instead of hardcoding to /usr/bin/python.
      - replace - Always return ``rc`` to ensure return values are consistent - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71963
      - script - skip in check mode if the plugin cannot determine if a change will
        occur (i.e. neither `creates` or `removes` are provided).
      - service - Fixed handling of sleep arguments during service restarts on AIX.
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76877)
      - service - Fixed service restarts with arguments on AIX. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76840)
      - service_facts module will now give more meaningful warnings when it fails
        to gather data.
      - set_fact/include_vars correctly handle delegation assignments within loops
      - setup - detect docker container with check for ./dockerenv or ./dockinit (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74349).
      - shell/command - only return changed as True if the task has not been skipped.
      - shell/command - only skip in check mode if the options `creates` and `removes`
        are both None.
      - ssh connection - properly quote controlpersist path given by user to avoid
        issues with spaces and other characters
      - ssh connection avoid parsing ssh cli debug lines as they can match expected
        output at high verbosities.
      - ssh connection now uses more correct host source as play_context can ignore
        loop/delegation variations.
      - sudo become plugin, fix handling of non interactive flags, previous substitution
        was too naive
      - systemd - check if service is alias so it gets enabled (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75538).
      - systemd - check if service is indirect so it gets enabled (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76453).
      - task_executor reverts the change to push facts into delegated vars on loop
        finalization as result managing code already handles this and was duplicating
        effort to wrong result.
      - template lookup - restore inadvertently deleted default for ``convert_data``
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77004)
      - to_json/to_nice_json filters defaults back to unvaulting/no unsafe packing.
      - unarchive - Fix zip archive file listing that caused issues with content postprocessing
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76067).
      - unarchive - Make extraction work when the LANGUAGE environment variable is
        set to a non-English locale.
      - unarchive - apply ``owner`` and ``group`` permissions to top folder (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/35426)
      - unarchive - include the original error when a handler cannot manage the archive
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/28977).
      - unarchive - the ``io_buffer_size`` option added in 2.12 was not accepted by
        the module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77271).
      - urls - Allow ``ca_path`` to point to a bundle containing multiple PEM certs
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75015)
      - urls/uri - Address case where ``HTTPError`` isn't fully initialized due to
        the error, and is missing certain methods and attributes (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76386)
      - user - allow ``password_expiry_min`` and ``password_expiry_min`` to be set
        to ``0`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75017)
      - user - allow password min and max to be set at the same time (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75017)
      - user - update logic to check if user exists or not in MacOS.
      - validate_argument_spec - Skip suboption validation if the top level option
        is an invalid type (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75612).
      - vault - Warn instead of fail for missing vault IDs if at least one valid vault
        secret is found.
      - winrm - Ensure ``kinit`` is run with the same ``PATH`` env var as the Ansible
        process
      - yum - prevent storing unnecessary cache data by running `yum makecache fast`
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76336)
      deprecated_features:
      - ansible-core - Remove support for Python 2.6.
      - ansible-test - Remove support for Python 2.6.
      - ssh connection plugin option scp_if_ssh in favor of ssh_transfer_method.
      known_issues:
      - get_url - document ``check_mode`` correctly with unreliable changed status
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65687).
      major_changes:
      - Jinja2 Controller Requirement - Jinja2 3.0.0 or newer is required for the
        control node (the machine that runs Ansible) (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/75881)
      - Templating - remove ``safe_eval`` in favor of using ``NativeEnvironment``
        but utilizing ``literal_eval`` only in cases when ``safe_eval`` was used (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/75587)
      minor_changes:
      - Action Plugins - Add helper method for argument spec validation, and extend
        to pause and async_wrapper
      - Added AIX root CA certs folders - enhance the TLS support in ``uri`` task
        on AIX
      - Added ``module_utils.compat.typing`` to facilitate type-hinting on all supported
        Python versions.
      - Ansible.Basic - small changes to allow use in PowerShell modules running on
        non-Windows platforms (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/76924).
      - AnsibleModule.run_command() now has a toggle to allow caller to decide to
        handle exceptions from executing the command itself
      - Attach concat function to an environment class (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/76282)
      - Clarify in a comment that unrolling an iterator in ``Templar._finalize`` is
        actually necessary. Also switch to using the ``_unroll_iterator`` decorator
        directly to deduplicate code in ``Templar._finalize``. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/76436)
      - Installation - modernize our python installation, to reduce dynamic code in
        setup.py, and migrate what is feasible to setup.cfg. This will enable shipping
        wheels in the future.
      - PlayIterator - introduce public methods to access ``PlayIterator._host_states``
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74416)
      - PlayIterator - use enums for Iterating and Failed states (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74511)
      - Reduce number of iterations through PlayIterator (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74175)
      - Remove more Python 2.x compatibility code from controller (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77320).
      - Start of moving away from using Six, Python 2 and 3 compatibility library
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/75863)
      - The collection loader now reports a Python warning if an attempt is made to
        install the Ansible collection loader a second time. Previously this condition
        was reported using an Ansible warning.
      - '``ansible-galaxy collection [install|verify]`` - allow user-provided signature
        sources in addition to those from the Galaxy server. Each collection entry
        in a requirements file can specify a ``signatures`` key followed by a list
        of sources. Collection name(s) provided on the CLI can specify additional
        signature sources by using the ``--signatures`` CLI option. Signature sources
        should be URIs that can be opened with ``urllib.request.urlopen()``, such
        as "https://example.com/path/to/detached_signature.asc" or "file:///path/to/detached_signature.asc".
        The ``--keyring`` option must be specified if signature sources are provided.'
      - '``ansible-galaxy collection [install|verify]`` - use gpg to verify the authenticity
        of the signed ``MANIFEST.json`` with ASCII armored detached signatures provided
        by the Galaxy server. The keyring (which is not managed by ``ansible-galaxy``)
        must be provided with the ``--keyring`` option to use signature verification.
        If no ``--keyring`` is specified and the collection to ``install|verify``
        has associated detached signatures on the Galaxy server, a warning is provided.'
      - '``ansible-galaxy collection install`` - Add a global configuration to modify
        the required number of signatures that must verify the authenticity of the
        collection. By default, the number of required successful signatures is 1.
        Set this option to ``all`` to require all signatures verify the collection.
        To ensure signature verification fails if there are no valid signatures, prepend
        the value with ''+'', such as ``+all`` or ``+1``.'
      - '``ansible-galaxy collection install`` - Add a global ignore list for gpg
        signature errors. This can be used to ignore certain signatures when the number
        of required successful signatures is all. When the required number of successful
        signatures is a positive integer, the only effect this has is to display fewer
        errors to the user on failure (success is determined by having the minimum
        number of successful signatures, in which case all errors are disregarded).'
      - '``ansible-galaxy collection install`` - Add a global toggle to turn off GPG
        signature verification.'
      - '``ansible-galaxy collection install`` - Store Galaxy server metadata alongside
        installed collections for provenance. Signatures obtained from the Galaxy
        server can be used for offline verification with ``ansible-galaxy collection
        verify --offline``.'

      - ansible-core modules - Remove unused Python shebangs from built-in modules.
      - ansible-doc metadata dump - add option ``--no-fail-on-errors`` which allows
        to not fail the ansible-doc invocation when errors happen during docs parsing
        or processing. Instead they are reported in the JSON result in an ``error``
        key for the affected plugins (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77035).
      - ansible-galaxy - the option to skip certificate verification now also applies
        when cloning via SCM (git/hg) (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/41077)

  2.13.1rc1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Add PyYAML >= 5.1 as a dependency of ansible-core to be compatible with Python
        3.8+.
      - ansible-config dump - Only display plugin type headers when plugin options
        are changed if --only-changed is specified.
      - ansible-galaxy - handle unsupported versions of resolvelib gracefully.
      - ansible-test - Fix internal validation of remote completion configuration.
      - ansible-test - Prevent ``--target-`` prefixed options for the ``shell`` command
        from being combined with legacy environment options.
      - ansible-test - Sanity test output with the ``--lint`` option is no longer
        mixed in with bootstrapping output.
      - ansible-test - Subprocesses are now isolated from the stdin, stdout and stderr
        of ansible-test. This avoids issues with subprocesses tampering with the file
        descriptors, such as SSH making them non-blocking. As a result of this change,
        subprocess output from unit and integration tests on stderr now go to stdout.
      - ansible-test - Subprocesses no longer have access to the TTY ansible-test
        is connected to, if any. This maintains consistent behavior between local
        testing and CI systems, which typically do not provide a TTY. Tests which
        require a TTY should use pexpect or another mechanism to create a PTY.
      - apt module now correctly handles virtual packages.
      - lookup plugin - catch KeyError when lookup returns dictionary (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77789).
      - pip - fix cases where resolution of pip Python module fails when importlib.util
        has not already been imported
      - plugin loader - Sort results when fuzzy matching plugin names (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77966).
      - plugin loader will now load config data for plugin by name instead of by file
        to avoid issues with the same file being loaded under different names (fqcn
        + short name).
      - psrp connection now handles default to inventory_hostname correctly.
      - winrm connection now handles default to inventory_hostname correctly.
      minor_changes:
      - "Add an 'action_plugin' field for modules in runtime.yml plugin_routing.\n\nThis
        fixes module_defaults by supporting modules-as-redirected-actions\nwithout
        redirecting module_defaults entries to the common action.\n\n.. code: yaml\n\n

      - ansible-galaxy - Support resolvelib versions 0.6.x, 0.7.x, and 0.8.x. The
        full range of supported versions is now >= 0.5.3, < 0.9.0.
      - ansible-test - Add RHEL 9.0 remote support.
      - ansible-test - Add support for Ubuntu VMs using the ``--remote`` option.
      - ansible-test - Add support for exporting inventory with ``ansible-test shell
        --export {path}``.
      - ansible-test - Add support for multi-arch remotes.
      - ansible-test - Add support for running non-interactive commands with ``ansible-test
        shell``.
      - ansible-test - Avoid using the ``mock_use_standalone_module`` setting for
        unit tests running on Python 3.8 or later.
      - ansible-test - Blocking mode is now enforced for stdin, stdout and stderr.
        If any of these are non-blocking then ansible-test will exit during startup
        with an error.
      - ansible-test - Improve consistency of output messages by using stdout or stderr
        for most output, but not both.
      - ansible-test - The ``shell`` command can be used outside a collection if no
        controller delegation is required.

      - Move undefined check from concat to finalize (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78156)
      - ansible-doc - no longer list module and plugin aliases that are created with
        symlinks (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/78137).
      - ansible-doc - when listing modules in collections, proceed recursively. This
        fixes module listing for community.general 5.x.y and community.network 4.x.y
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/78137).
      - ansible-doc will not add 'website for' in ":ref:" substitutions as it made
        them confusing.
      - file backed cache plugins now handle concurrent access by making atomic updates
        to the files.
      - password lookup does not ignore k=v arguments anymore.
      - user - Fix error "Permission denied" in user module while generating SSH keys
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78017).
      minor_changes:
      - ansible-test - An improved error message is shown when the download of a pip
        bootstrap script fails. The download now uses ``urllib2`` instead of ``urllib``
        on Python 2.

      bugfixes:
      - Avoid 'unreachable' error when chmod on AIX has 255 as return code.
      - Fix PluginLoader to mimic Python import machinery by adding module to sys.modules
        before exec
      - Fix dnf module documentation to indicate that comparison operators for package
        version require spaces around them (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78295)
      - ansible-connection - decrypt vaulted parameters before sending over the socket,
        as vault secrets are not available on the other side.
      - ansible-galaxy - Fix reinitializing the whole collection directory with ``ansible-galaxy
        collection init ns.coll --force``. Now directories and files that are not
        included in the collection skeleton will be removed.
      - ansible-galaxy - do not require mandatory keys in the ``galaxy.yml`` of source
        collections when listing them (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70180).
      - ansible-galaxy - fix listing collections that contains metadata but the namespace
        or name are not strings.
      - ansible-galaxy - fix setting the cache for paginated responses from Galaxy
        NG/AH (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77911).
      - ansible-test - Delegation for commands which generate output for programmatic
        consumption no longer redirect all output to stdout. The affected commands
        and options are ``shell``, ``sanity --lint``, ``sanity --list-tests``, ``integration
        --list-targets``, ``coverage analyze``
      - ansible-test - Delegation now properly handles arguments given after ``--``
        on the command line.
      - 'ansible-test - Test configuration for collections is now parsed only once,
        prior to delegation. Fixes issue: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78334'
      - ansible-test - The ``shell`` command no longer redirects all output to stdout
        when running a provided command. Any command output written to stderr will
        be mixed with the stderr output from ansible-test.
      - ansible-test - The ``shell`` command no longer requests a TTY when using delegation
        unless an interactive shell is being used. An interactive shell is the default
        behavior when no command is given to pass to the shell.
      - dnf - fix output parsing on systems with ``LANGUAGE`` set to a language other
        than English (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78193)
      - if a config setting prevents running ansible it should at least show it's
        "origin".
      - prevent type annotation shim failures from causing runtime failures (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77860)
      - template module/lookup - fix ``convert_data`` option that was effectively
        always set to True for Jinja macros (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78141)
      - uri - properly use uri parameter use_proxy (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/58632)

        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79117)
      - ansible-galaxy - make initial call to Galaxy server on-demand only when installing,
        getting info about, and listing roles.
      - ansible-test - Add ``wheel < 0.38.0`` constraint for Python 3.6 and earlier.
      - copy module will no longer move 'non files' set as src when remote_src=true.
      - file lookup now handles missing files more gracefully.
      - service_facts - Use python re to parse service output instead of grep (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78541)
      - updated error messages to include 'acl' and not just mode changes when failing
        to set required permissions on remote.

  2.13.8rc1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Ansible.Basic.cs - Ignore compiler warning (reported as an error) when running
        under PowerShell 7.3.x.
      - TaskExecutor - don't ignore templated _raw_params that k=v parser failed to
        parse (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79862)
      - ansible-test - Always remove containers after failing to create/run them.
        This avoids leaving behind created containers when using podman.
      - ansible-test - Avoid using ``exec`` after container startup when possible.
        This improves container startup performance and avoids intermittent startup
        issues with some old containers.
      - ansible-test - Connection attempts to managed remote instances no longer abort
        on ``Permission denied`` errors.
      - ansible-test - Detection for running in a Podman or Docker container has been
        fixed to detect more scenarios. The new detection relies on ``/proc/self/mountinfo``
        instead of ``/proc/self/cpuset``. Detection now works with custom cgroups
        and private cgroup namespaces.
      - ansible-test - Fix bootstrapping of Python 3.9 on Ubuntu 20.04 remotes.
      - ansible-test - Fix validate-modules error when retrieving PowerShell argspec
        when retrieved inside a Cmdlet
      - ansible-test - Handle server errors when executing the ``docker info`` command.
      - ansible-test - Multiple containers now work under Podman without specifying
        the ``--docker-network`` option.
      - ansible-test - Pass the ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` environment variable through to
        container commands.
      - ansible-test - Perform PyPI proxy configuration after instances are ready
        and bootstrapping has been completed. Only target instances are affected,
        as controller instances were already handled this way. This avoids proxy configuration
        errors when target instances are not yet ready for use.
      - ansible-test - Prevent concurrent / repeat inspections of the same container
        image.
      - ansible-test - Prevent concurrent / repeat pulls of the same container image.
      - ansible-test - Prevent concurrent execution of cached methods.
      - ansible-test - Show the exception type when reporting errors during instance
        provisioning.
      - ansible-test - Support Podman 4.4.0+ by adding the ``SYS_CHROOT`` capability
        when running containers.
      - ansible-test - Temporary executables are now verified as executable after
        creation. Without this check, path injected scripts may not be found, typically
        on systems with ``/tmp`` mounted using the "noexec" option. This can manifest
        as a missing Python interpreter, or use of the wrong Python interpreter, as
        well as other error conditions.
      - ansible-test - Test containers are now run with the ``--tmpfs`` option for
        ``/tmp``, ``/run`` and ``/run/lock``. This allows use of containers built
        without the ``VOLUME`` instruction. Additionally, containers with those volumes
        defined no longer create anonymous volumes for them. This avoids leaving behind
        volumes on the container host after the container is stopped and deleted.
      - ansible-test - fix warning message about failing to run an image to include
        the image name
      - file - touch action in check mode was always returning ok. Fix now evaluates
        the different conditions and returns the appropriate changed status. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79360)
      known_issues:
      - ansible-test - Additional configuration may be required for certain container
        host and container combinations. Further details are available in the testing
        documentation.
      - ansible-test - Custom containers with ``VOLUME`` instructions may be unable
        to start, when previously the containers started correctly. Remove the ``VOLUME``
        instructions to resolve the issue. Containers with this condition will cause
        ``ansible-test`` to emit a warning.
      - ansible-test - Systems with Podman networking issues may be unable to run
        containers, when previously the issue went unreported. Correct the networking
        issues to continue using ``ansible-test`` with Podman.
      - ansible-test - Using Docker on systems with SELinux may require setting SELinux
        to permissive mode. Podman should work with SELinux in enforcing mode.
      major_changes:
      - ansible-test - Docker Desktop on WSL2 is now supported (additional configuration
        required).
      - ansible-test - Docker and Podman are now supported on hosts with cgroup v2
        unified. Previously only cgroup v1 and cgroup v2 hybrid were supported.
      - ansible-test - Podman now works on container hosts without systemd. Previously
        only some containers worked, while others required rootfull or rootless Podman,
        but would not work with both. Some containers did not work at all.
      - ansible-test - Podman on WSL2 is now supported.
      - ansible-test - When additional cgroup setup is required on the container host,
        this will be automatically detected. Instructions on how to configure the
        host will be provided in the error message shown.
      minor_changes:
      - ansible-test - A new ``audit`` option is available when running custom containers.
        This option can be used to indicate whether a container requires the AUDIT_WRITE
        capability. The default is ``required``, which most containers will need when
        using Podman. If necessary, the ``none`` option can be used to opt-out of
        the capability. This has no effect on Docker, which always provides the capability.
      - ansible-test - A new ``cgroup`` option is available when running custom containers.
        This option can be used to indicate a container requires cgroup v1 or that
        it does not use cgroup. The default behavior assumes the container works with
        cgroup v2 (as well as v1).
      - ansible-test - Add support for provisioning Alpine 3.16 remote instances.
      - ansible-test - Add support for provisioning Fedora 36 remote instances.
      - ansible-test - Add support for provisioning Ubuntu 20.04 remote instances.
      - ansible-test - Add support for provisioning remotes which require ``doas``
        for become.
      - ansible-test - Additional log details are shown when containers fail to start
        or SSH connections to containers fail.
      - ansible-test - Alpine remotes now use ``sudo`` for tests, using ``doas`` only
        for bootstrapping.
      - ansible-test - Become support for remote instance provisioning is no longer
        tied to a fixed list of platforms.
      - ansible-test - Connection failures to remote provisioned hosts now show failure
        details as a warning.
      - ansible-test - Containers included with ansible-test no longer disable seccomp
        by default.
      - ansible-test - Failure to connect to a container over SSH now results in a
        clear error. Previously tests would be attempted even after initial connection
        attempts failed.
      - ansible-test - FreeBSD remotes now use ``sudo`` for tests, using ``su`` only
        for bootstrapping.
      - ansible-test - Integration tests can be excluded from retries triggered by
        the ``--retry-on-error`` option by adding the ``retry/never`` alias. This
        is useful for tests that cannot pass on a retry or are too slow to make retries
        useful.
      - ansible-test - More details are provided about an instance when provisioning
        fails.
      - ansible-test - Reduce the polling limit for SSHD startup in containers from
        60 retries to 10. The one second delay between retries remains in place.
      - ansible-test - Remote Alpine instances now have the ``acl`` package installed.
      - ansible-test - Remote Fedora instances now have the ``acl`` package installed.
      - ansible-test - Remote FreeBSD instances now have ACLs enabled on the root
        filesystem.
      - ansible-test - Remote Ubuntu instances now have the ``acl`` package installed.
      - ansible-test - SSH connections from OpenSSH 8.8+ to CentOS 6 containers now
        work without additional configuration. However, clients older than OpenSSH
        7.0 can no longer connect to CentOS 6 containers as a result. The container
        must have ``centos6`` in the image name for this work-around to be applied.
      - ansible-test - SSH shell connections from OpenSSH 8.8+ to ansible-test provisioned
        network instances now work without additional configuration. However, clients
        older than OpenSSH 7.0 can no longer open shell sessions for ansible-test
        provisioned network instances as a result.
      - 'ansible-test - Specify the configuration file location required by test plugins
        when the config file is not found. This resolves issue: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79411'
      - ansible-test - The ``ansible-test env`` command now detects and reports the
        container ID if running in a container.
      - ansible-test - Unit tests now support network disconnect by default when running
        under Podman. Previously this feature only worked by default under Docker.
      - ansible-test - Use ``stop --time 0`` followed by ``rm`` to remove ephemeral
        containers instead of ``rm -f``. This speeds up teardown of ephemeral containers.
      - ansible-test - Warnings are now shown when using containers that were built
        with VOLUME instructions.
      - ansible-test - When setting the max open files for containers, the container
        host's limit will be checked. If the host limit is lower than the preferred
        value, it will be used and a warning will be shown.
      - ansible-test - When using Podman, ansible-test will detect if the loginuid
        used in containers is incorrect. When this occurs a warning is displayed and
        the container is run with the AUDIT_CONTROL capability. Previously containers
        would fail under this situation, with no useful warnings or errors given.
      - ansible-test acme test container - update version to update used Pebble version,
        underlying Python and Go base containers, and Python requirements (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79783).
