  2.11.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - ansible-test - ensure the correct unit test target is given when the ``__init__.py``
        file is modified inside the connection plugins directory
      major_changes:
      - ansible-test - Tests run with the ``centos6`` and ``default`` test containers
        now use a PyPI proxy container to access PyPI when Python 2.6 is used. This
        allows tests running under Python 2.6 to continue functioning even though
        PyPI is discontinuing support for non-SNI capable clients.
      minor_changes:
      - ansible-test - Update distribution test containers from version 2.0.1 to 2.0.2.
      - ansible-test - Update the Ansible Core and Ansible Collection default test
        containers to 3.2.0 and 3.2.2 respectively.

    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Made SCM collections be reinstalled regardless of ``--force`` being present.
      - NetBSD virtualization facts (specifically ``ansible_virtualization_type``)
        now returns a more accurate value by checking the value of the ``machdep.hypervisor``
        ``sysctl`` key. This change is breaking because in some cases previously,
        we would erroneously report ``xen`` even when the target is not running on
        Xen. This prevents that behavior in most cases. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69352)
      - "Replaced the in-tree dependency resolver with an external implementation
        that pip >= 20.3 uses now by default \u2014 ``resolvelib``. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71784)"
      - The ``meta`` module now supports tags for user-defined tasks. Internal ``meta``
        tasks continue to always run. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64558)
      - ansible-galaxy login command has been removed (see https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71560)
      bugfixes:
      - ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS - remove deprecation so that users of Ansible 2.9
        and 2.10+ can use the same var when specifying a collection path without a
        warning.
      - Added unsafe_writes test.
      - Address compat with rpmfluff-0.6 for integration tests
      - 'Address the deprecation of the use of stdlib distutils in packaging. It''s
        a short-term hotfix for the problem (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70456,
        https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2230, https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/commit/bd110264)

        '
      - Adjust various hard-coded action names to also include their ``ansible.builtin.``
        and ``ansible.legacy.`` prefixed version (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71817,
        https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71818, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71824).
      - Allow TypeErrors on Undefined variables in filters to be handled or deferred
        when processing for loops.
      - Allow `~` to be present in file names in galaxy roles (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/72966)
      - Always mention the name of the deprecated or tombstoned plugin in routing
        deprecation/tombstone messages (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73059).
      - Ansible output now uses stdout to determine column width instead of stdin
      - AnsibleModule - added arg ``ignore_invalid_cwd`` to ``AnsibleModule.run_command()``,
        to control its behaviour when ``cwd`` is invalid. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72390)
      - Apply ``_wrap_native_text`` only for builtin filters specified in STRING_TYPE_FILTERS.
      - Be smarter about collection paths ending with ansible_collections, emulating
        a-galaxy behaviour. Issue 72628
      - CLI - Restore git information in version output when running from source
      - Collection callbacks were ignoring options and rules for stdout and adhoc
        cases.
      - Collections - Ensure ``action_loader.get`` is called with ``collection_list``
        to properly find collections when ``collections:`` search is specified (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/72170)
      - Command module now returns stdout & stderr if executable is missing or an
        unknown error occurs
      - ConfigManager - Normalize ConfigParser between Python2 and Python3 to for
        handling comments (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73709)

      - Fix bytestring vs string comparison in module_utils.basic.is_special_selinux_path()
        so that special-cased filesystems which don't support SELinux context attributes
        still allow files to be manipulated on them. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70244)
      - Fix execution of the meta tasks 'clear_facts', 'clear_host_errors', 'end_play',
        'end_host', and 'reset_connection' when the CLI flag '--flush-cache' is provided.

        to show in all cases, even when not specified by the user.
      - Fixed TypeError instancemethod expecting at least 2 arguments for apt_repository(issue
        https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69308, PR https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/69463)

        ``oraclelinux 8`` when other pythons are present.
      - Improve Ansible config deprecations to show the source of the deprecation
        (ansible-core). Also remove space before a comma in config deprecations (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72697).
      - Improved/fixed regular expressions in ``validate-modules/validate_modules/schema.py``
        and ``utils/collection_loader/_collection_finder.py`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73577).
      - Includes - Explicitly get the include task, and not assume it is the parent
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65710)
      - InventoryManager - Fix unhandled exception when given limit file was actually
        a directory.
      - InventoryManager - Fix unhandled exception when inventory directory was empty
        or contained empty subdirectories (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73658).
      - JSON Encoder - Ensure we treat single vault encrypted values as strings (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70784)
      - Lookup user by UID in password database if login name is not found (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/17029)
      - Pass expression in angle-bracket notation as filename argument to a ``compile()``
        built-in function, so that Python debuggers do not try to parse it as filename.
      - Pass the connection's timeout to connection plugins instead of the task's
        timeout.
      - Provide more information in AnsibleUndefinedVariable (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/55152)

        `community.okd <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/okd>`_, and `kubernetes.core
        <https://galaxy.ansible.com/kubernetes/core>`_ (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72428).
      - The ``flush()`` method of ``CachePluginAdjudicator`` now calls the plugin's
        ``flush()`` method instead of iterating over the keys that the adjudicator
        knows about and deleting those from the cache. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68770)
      - The `ansible_become` value was not being treated as a boolean value when set
        in an INI format inventory file (fixes bug https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70476).
      - The machine-readable changelog ``changelogs/changelog.yaml`` is now contained
        in the release.
      - Updated docs and added warning on max_fail_percentage and free strategy usage.

      - allow become method 'su' to work on 'local' connection by allocating a fake
        tty.
      - ansible-console - Ctrl+C (in a task) abort current task, and put you back
        on prompt (this behavior doesn't change) (ditto)
      - ansible-console - Ctrl+C (on prompt) used to exit the shell, unlike most shells,
        it should just reset the current line (ie. abort it and spawn a new prompt)
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68529)
      - ansible-console - Ctrl+D (on prompt) now exit the shell, this is the expected
        behavior in a shell (cf bash, sh, zsh, ipython, ...) (ditto)

        added (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71735).
      - ansible-doc - properly show plugin name when ``name:`` is used instead of
        ``<plugin_type>:`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71966).
      - ansible-galaxy - Cache the responses for available collection versions after
        getting all pages. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73071)
      - ansible-galaxy - Instead of assuming the first defined server is galaxy, filter
        based on the servers that support the v1 API, and return the first of those
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65440)
      - ansible-galaxy - Use ``sys.exit`` instead of ``exit`` when reporting an error
        for the removed login command.
      - ansible-galaxy - correct ``collections-path`` command line argument (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73127)

      - ansible-test - Always connect additional Docker containers to the network
        used by the current container (if any).
      - ansible-test - Always map ``/var/run/docker.sock`` into test containers created
        by the ``--docker`` option if the docker host is not ``localhost``.
      - ansible-test - Attempt to detect the Docker hostname instead of assuming ``localhost``.
      - ansible-test - Avoid using ``/tmp`` to resolve occasional failures starting

      - ansible-test - Change classification using ``--changed`` now consistently
        handles common configuration files for supported CI providers.
      - ansible-test - Change detection now properly resolves relative imports instead
        of treating them as absolute imports.
      - ansible-test - Correctly detect changes in a GitHub pull request when running

      - ansible-test - Do not try to validate PowerShell modules ``setup.ps1``, ``slurp.ps1``,
        and ``async_status.ps1``
      - ansible-test - Prefer container IP at ``.NetworkSettings.Networks.{NetworkName}.IPAddress``
        over ``.NetworkSettings.IPAddress``.
      - ansible-test - Running tests using an installed version of ``ansible-test``
        against one Python version from another no longer fails due to a missing ``egg-info``
        directory. This could occur when testing plugins which import ``pkg_resources``.
      - ansible-test - Running tests using an installed version of ``ansible-test``
        no longer generates an error attempting to create an ``egg-info`` directory
        when an existing one is not found in the expected location. This could occur
        if the existing ``egg-info`` directory included a Python version specifier
        in the name.
      - ansible-test - Skip installing requirements if they are already installed.
      - ansible-test - Symbolic links are no longer used to inject ``python`` into
        the environment, since they do not work reliably in all cases. Instead, the
        existing Python based exec wrapper is always used.
      - ansible-test - Temporarily limit ``cryptography`` to versions before 3.4 to
        enable tests to function.
      - ansible-test - The ``--raw`` option for ``ansible-test shell --remote`` now
        uses ``sh`` for the shell instead of ``bash``, which may not be present.
      - ansible-test - The ``--remote`` option has been updated for Python 2.7 to
        work around breaking changes in the newly released ``get-pip.py`` bootstrapper.
      - ansible-test - The ``--remote`` option has been updated to use a versioned
        ``get-pip.py`` bootstrapper to avoid issues with future releases.
      - ansible-test - The ``ansible-doc`` sanity test now works for ``netconf`` plugins.
      - ansible-test - The ``changelog`` sanity test has been updated to ensure ``rstcheck``
        does not load the ``sphinx`` module.
      - ansible-test - The ``cs`` and ``openshift`` test plugins now search for containers
        on the current network instead of assuming the ``bridge`` network.
      - ansible-test - The ``resource_prefix`` variable provided to tests running
        on Azure Pipelines is now converted to lowercase to match other CI providers.
      - ansible-test - Unified SSH key management for all instances created with the
        ``--remote`` or ``--docker`` options.
      - ansible-test - Using the ``--remote`` option on Azure Pipelines now works
        from a job running in a container.
      - ansible-test - ``cryptography`` is now limited to versions prior to 3.2 only
        when an incompatible OpenSSL version (earlier than 1.1.0) is detected
      - 'ansible-test - add constraint for ``cffi`` to prevent failure on systems
        with older versions of ``gcc`` (https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/cffi/-/issues/480)

        '
      - ansible-test - convert target paths to unicode on Python 2 to avoid ``UnicodeDecodeError``
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68398, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72623).
      - ansible-test - improve classification of changes to ``.gitignore``, ``COPYING``,
        ``LICENSE``, ``Makefile``, and all files ending with one of ``.in`, ``.md`,
        ``.rst``, ``.toml``, ``.txt`` in the collection root directory (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72353).
      - ansible-test - integration and unit test change detection now works for filter,
        lookup and test plugins
      - ansible-test now always uses the ``--python`` option for ``virtualenv`` to
        select the correct interpreter when creating environments with the ``--venv``
        option
      - ansible-test sanity changelog test - bump dependency on antsibull-changelog
        to 0.9.0 so that `fragments that add new plugins or objects <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/blob/main/docs/changelogs.rst#adding-new-roles-playbooks-test-and-filter-plugins>`_
        will not fail validation (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73428).
      - ansible-test units - fixed collection location code to work under pytest >=
        6.0.0
      - ansible-test validate-modules - ``version_added`` on module level was not
        validated for modules in collections (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/70869).
      - ansible-test validate-modules - return correct error codes ``option-invalid-version-added``
        resp. ``return-invalid-version-added`` instead of the wrong error ``deprecation-either-date-or-version``
        when an invalid value of ``version_added`` is specified for an option or a
        return value (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/70869).
      - ansible-test validate-modules - when a module uses ``add_file_common_args=True``
        and does not use a keyword argument for ``argument_spec`` in ``AnsibleModule()``,
        the common file arguments were not considered added during validation (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72334).
      - ansible_pkg_mgr fact - now correctly returns ``atomic_container`` when run
        on "RHEL for Edge" images and Fedora/RHEL/CentOS Atomic Host (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73084).
      - api - time.clock is removed in Python 3.8, add backward compatible code (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70649).

        to warn and suggest modules in lieu of commands. The ``warn`` parameter to
        these modules is now deprecated and defaults to ``False``. Similarly, the
        ``COMMAND_WARNINGS`` configuration option is also deprecated and defaults
        to ``False``. These will be removed and their presence will become an error
        in 2.14.
      - apt_key - the paramater ``key`` does not have any effect, has been deprecated
        and will be removed in ansible-core version 2.14 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/70319).

        multi-word search keys can now be passed.
      - The ``csvfile`` lookup plugin's documentation has been fixed; it erroneously
        said that the delimiter could be ``t`` which was never true. We now accept
        ``\t``, however, and the error in the documentation has been fixed to note
        that.
      - The constructed inventory plugin has new option to force using vars plugins
        on previouslly processed inventory sources.

        if it exists in the target directory.
      - The plugin loader now keeps track of the collection where a plugin was resolved
        to, in particular whether the plugin was loaded from ansible-core's internal
        paths (``ansible.builtin``) or from user-supplied paths (no collection name).
      - Toggle allowing usage of extra_vars in compose
      - When connecting as an unprivileged user, and becoming an unprivileged user,
        we now fall back to also trying ``chmod +a`` which works on macOS and makes
        use of ACLs.
      - allow tree callback plugin to be configurable, for use with playbooks.
      - ansible-doc - In Windows setup steps, ``ExecutionPolicy`` should be restored
        to default value ``RemoteSigned`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72993).

        versions to provide consistent test results.
      - ansible-test - Most sanity test specific ``pip`` constraints are now used

      - ansible-test - Removed ``pip`` constraints related to integration tests that
        have been moved to collections. This should reduce conflicts with ``pip``
        requirements and constraints when testing collections.

        be used instead.
      - ansible-test - The ``default`` container for both collections and core have
        been updated to versions 2.11.0 and 1.9.0 respectively.

        for controlling password expiration (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68775)
      - varnames lookup plugin - Fixed grammar error in exception message when the
        plugin is given a non-string term.
      - vault - Provide better error for single value encrypted values to indicate
        the file, line, and column of the errant vault (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/72276)
      - version test - Add semantic version functionality
      - virtual facts - containerd cgroup is now recognized as container tech (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66304).

      - winrm - Added ``ansible_winrm_kinit_args`` that can be used to control the
        args that are sent to the ``kinit`` call for Kerberos authentication.
      - yum - module now works under any supported Python interpreter
      - yum_repository - added boolean option module_hotfixes which allows to enable

        '
      removed_features:
      - Removed `SharedPluginLoaderObj` class from ansible.plugins.strategy. It was
        deprecated in favor of using the standard plugin loader.
      - Removed `_get_item()` alias from callback plugin base class which had been
        deprecated in favor of `_get_item_label()`.
      - The "user" parameter was previously deprecated and is now removed in favor
        of "scope"
      - The deprecated ``ansible.constants.BECOME_METHODS`` has been removed.
      - The deprecated ``ansible.constants.get_config()`` has been removed.
      - The deprecated ``ansible.constants.mk_boolean()`` has been removed.
      - '`with_*` loops are no longer optimized for modules whose `name` parameters
        can take lists (mostly package managers). Use `name` instead of looping over
        individual names with `with_items` and friends.'
      security_fixes:
      - '**security issue** - Mask default and fallback values for ``no_log`` module
        options (CVE-2021-20228)'
      - '**security issue** - copy - Redact the value of the no_log ''content'' parameter
        in the result''s invocation.module_args in check mode. Previously when used
        with check mode and with ''-vvv'', the module would not censor the content
        if a change would be made to the destination path. (CVE-2020-14332)

        '
      - Sanitize no_log values from any response keys that might be returned from
        the uri module (CVE-2020-14330).
      - dnf - Previously, regardless of the ``disable_gpg_check`` option, packages
        were not GPG validated. They are now. (CVE-2020-14365)

      name: validate_argument_spec
      namespace: ''
    release_date: '2021-03-02'
  2.11.0b2:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - A handler defined within a role will now search handlers subdir for included
        tasks (issue https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71222).
      - ALLOW_WORLD_READABLE_TMP, switched to 'moved' message as 'deprecation' is
        misleading since config settings still work w/o needing change.
      - Automatically remove async cache files for polled async tasks that have completed
        (issue https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73206).
      - Deal with failures when sorting JSON and you have incompatible key types.
      - Setup virtualization_facts - add RHV and oVirt type. This change will fully
        work for VMs in clusters at cluster level 4.4 or newer (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72876).
      - '[set_fact] Corrected and expanded documentation as well as now raise errors
        that were previously ignored.'
      - ansible-test - ensure unit test paths for connection and inventory plugins
        are correctly identified for collections (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73876).
      - connection/ssh, ensure parameters come from correct source get_option, so
        functionality matches docs.
      - connection/ssh, fix reset to use same parameters to check if socket exists
        as actually used, was hardcoded to default string construction previouslly.
      - j2 plugin loader clarified comments, made note with better fqcn detection.
      - notify keyword is not ignored anymore on import_tasks, also able to apply
        to blocks now.
      - restrict module valid JSON parsed output to objects as lists are not valid
        responses.
      - setup, don't give up on all local facts gathering if one script file fails.
      - su become plugin, ensure correct type for localization option.
      minor_changes:
      - ansible-test - The generated ``resource_prefix`` variable now meets the host
        name syntax requirements specified in RFC 1123 and RFC 952. The value used
        for local tests now places the random number before the hostname component,
        rather than after. If the resulting value is too long, it will be truncated.
      - ansible-test validate-modules - option names that seem to indicate they contain
        secret information that should be marked ``no_log=True`` are now flagged in
        the validate-modules sanity test. False positives can be marked by explicitly
        setting ``no_log=False`` for these options in the argument spec. Please note
        that many false positives are expected; the assumption is that it is by far
        better to have false positives than false negatives (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73508).
      - distribution - add facts about Amazon Linux Distribution facts (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73742).
      - module payload builder - module_utils imports in any nested block (eg, ``try``,
        ``if``) are treated as optional during module payload builds; this allows
        modules to implement runtime fallback behavior for module_utils that do not
        exist in older versions of Ansible.

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix adding unrelated candidate names to the plugin loader redirect list.
      - Strategy - When building the task in the Strategy from the Worker, ensure
        it is properly marked as finalized and squashed. Addresses an issue with ``ansible_failed_task``.
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/57399)
      - ansible-pull - Run all playbooks that when multiple are supplied via the command
        line (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/72708)
      - find module, fix default pattern when use_regex is true.
      major_changes:
      - AnsibleModule - use ``ArgumentSpecValidator`` class for validating argument
        spec and remove private methods related to argument spec validation. Any modules
        using private methods should now use the ``ArgumentSpecValidator`` class or
        the appropriate validation function.
      minor_changes:
      - Callbacks - Migrate more places in the ``TaskExecutor`` to sending callbacks
        directly over the queue, instead of sending them as ``TaskResult`` and short
        circuiting in the Strategy to send the callback. This enables closer to real
        time callbacks of retries and loop results (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73899)
      - setup - fix distribution facts for Older Amazon Linux with ``/etc/os-release``
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73946).

        and action plugins.
      - Try to avoid kernel 'blocking' state on reading files while fact gathering.
      - apt - fix policy_rc_d parameter throwing an exception when restoring original
        file (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66211)

      - setup module, fix error handling on bad subset given
      - wait_for module, move missing socket into function to get proper comparrison
        in time.
      minor_changes:

      - WorkerProcess - Implement workaround for stdout deadlock in multiprocessing
        shutdown to avoid process hangs.
      - ansible-test - Add a ``six < 1.14.0`` constraint for Python 2.6.
      - ansible-test - The ``--export`` option for ``ansible-test coverage`` is now
        limited to the ``combine`` command. It was previously available for reporting
        commands on which it had no effect.
      - ansible-test - The ``ansible-test coverage combine`` option ``--export`` now
        exports relative paths. This avoids loss of coverage data when aggregating
        across systems with different absolute paths. Paths will be converted back
        to absolute when generating reports.
      - debug action, prevent setting facts when displaying ansible_facts.

  2.11.1rc1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Add RockyLinux to fact gathering (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74530).
      - Improve resilience of ``ansible-galaxy collection`` by increasing the page
        size to make fewer requests overall and retrying queries with a jittered exponential
        backoff when rate limiting HTTP codes (520 and 429) occur. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74191)
      - Prevent ``ansible_failed_task`` from further templating (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74036)
      - Remove 'default' from ssh plugin as we want to rely on default from ssh itself
        or ssh/config.
      - The error message about the failure to import a ``gpg`` key by the ``apt_key``
        module was incorrect (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74423).
      - ansible-test - Avoid publishing the port used by the ``pypi-test-container``
        since it is only accessed by other containers. This avoids issues when trying
        to run tests in parallel on a single host.
      - ansible-test - Fix docker container IP address detection. The ``bridge`` network
        is no longer assumed to be the default.
      - ansible-test - Use documented API to retrieve build information from Azure
        Pipelines.
      - ansible.builtin.cron - Keep non-empty crontabs, when removing cron jobs (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74497).
      - ansible.utils.encrypt now handles missing or unusable 'crypt' library.
      - ansible_test - add constraint for ``MarkupSafe`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74666)
      - apt_key - Binary GnuPG keys downloaded via URLs were corrupted so GnuPG could
        not import them (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74424).
      - become - fix a regression on Solaris where chmod can return 5 which we interpret
        as auth failure and stop trying become tmpdir permission fallbacks
      - become - work around setfacl not existing on modern Solaris (and possibly
        failing on some filesystems even when it does exist)
      - callback default, now uses task delegate_to instead of delegate vars to display
        delegate to host
      - callbacks, restores missing delegate_vars
      - correct doc links for become on warnings over world readable settings.
      - correctly use world readable setting since old constant is not 'settable'
        anymore.
      - facts - detect homebrew installed at /opt/homebrew/bin/brew
      - filter plugins - patch new versions of Jinja2 to prevent warnings/errors on
        renamed filter decorators (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74667)
      - get_url - Fixed checksum validation for binary files (leading asterisk) in
        checksum files (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74502).
      - hostname - Add Rocky Linux support
      - ini lookup - handle errors for duplicate keys and missing sections (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74601)
      - interpreter discovery - Debian 8 and lower will avoid unsupported Python3
        version in interpreter discovery
      - pause - ensure control characters are always set to an appropriate value (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73264)
      - playbook loaded from collection subdir now does not ignore subdirs.
      - plugin config now allows list type options to have multiple valid choices
        (#74225).
      - replace - better handling of file operation exceptions (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74686).
      - roles - allow for role arg specs in new meta file (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74525).
      - service - compare version without LooseVersion API (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74488).
      minor_changes:
      - ansible adhoc, clarified the help to some options, also added some comments
        to code.
      - command - update the user warning message to point out command name (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74475).

  2.11.3rc1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Add unicode support to ``ansible-inventory`` CLI (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/57378)
      - Ensure we get full path for extra vars into cliargs to avoid realpath issues
        after initial load.
      - ansible-doc - in text output, do not show empty ``version_added_collection``
        values (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74999).
      - ansible-test - restrict ``packaging`` to ``< 21.0`` for Python ``< 3.6`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/75186).
      - command - remove unreachable code path when trying to convert the value for
        ``chdir`` to bytes (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/75036)
      - module_common - handle exception when multiple workers try to create the cache
        directory
      - roles - make sure argspec validation task templates suboptions (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75070).
      - slurp - improve the logic in the error handling and remove ``os.stat()`` call
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/75038)
      - ssh_connection - rename ``retries`` to ``reconnection_retries`` to avoid conflicts
        with task vars (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75142).
      - ssh_connection - set the default for ``reconnection_retries`` back to ``0``
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75142).
      - task_executor/ssh_connection - use the ``retries`` value from ``ssh_connection``
        settings, not the default from the ``Task`` field attributes (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75142).
      minor_changes:
      - ansible-test - aws creates and exposes a new tiny_prefix variable to provide
        a shorter prefix for the AWS tests.
