  2.16.0b1:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Any plugin using the config system and the `cli` entry to use the `timeout`
        from the command line, will see the value change if the use had configured
        it in any of the lower precedence methods. If relying on this behaviour to
        consume the global/generic timeout from the DEFAULT_TIMEOUT constant, please
        consult the documentation on plugin configuration to add the overlaping entries.
      - ansible-test - Test plugins that rely on containers no longer support reusing
        running containers. The previous behavior was an undocumented, untested feature.
      - service module will not permanently configure variables/flags for openbsd
        when doing enable/disable operation anymore, this module was never meant to
        do this type of work, just to manage the service state itself. A rcctl_config
        or similar module should be created and used instead.
      bugfixes:
      - Allow for searching handler subdir for included task via include_role (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81722)
      - AnsibleModule.run_command - Only use selectors when needed, and rely on Python
        stdlib subprocess for the simple task of collecting stdout/stderr when prompt
        matching is not required.
      - Display - Defensively configure writing to stdout and stderr with a custom
        encoding error handler that will replace invalid characters while providing
        a deprecation warning that non-utf8 text will result in an error in a future
        version.
      - Exclude internal options from man pages and docs.
      - Fix ``ansible-config init`` man page option indentation.
      - Fix ``ast`` deprecation warnings for ``Str`` and ``value.s`` when using Python
        3.12.
      - Fix exceptions caused by various inputs when performing arg splitting or parsing
        key/value pairs. Resolves issue https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/46379
        and issue https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/61497
      - Fix incorrect parsing of multi-line Jinja2 blocks when performing arg splitting
        or parsing key/value pairs.
      - Fix post-validating looped task fields so the strategy uses the correct values
        after task execution.
      - Fixed `pip` module failure in case of usage quotes for `virtualenv_command`
        option for the venv command. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76372)
      - From issue https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80880, when notifying
        a handler from another handler, handler notifications must be registered immediately
        as the flush_handler call is not recursive.
      - Import ``FILE_ATTRIBUTES`` from ``ansible.module_utils.common.file`` in ``ansible.module_utils.basic``
        instead of defining it twice.
      - Inventory scripts parser not treat exception when getting hostsvar (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81103)
      - On Python 3 use datetime methods ``fromtimestamp`` and ``now`` with UTC timezone
        instead of ``utcfromtimestamp`` and ``utcnow``, which are deprecated in Python
        3.12.
      - PluginLoader - fix Jinja plugin performance issues (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79652)
      - PowerShell - Remove some code which is no longer valid for dotnet 5+
      - Prevent running same handler multiple times when included via ``include_role``
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73643)
      - Prompting - add a short sleep between polling for user input to reduce CPU
        consumption (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81516).
      - Properly disable ``jinja2_native`` in the template module when jinja2 override
        is used in the template (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80605)
      - Remove unreachable parser error for removed ``static`` parameter of ``include_role``
      - Replace uses of ``configparser.ConfigParser.readfp()`` which was removed in
        Python 3.12 with ``configparser.ConfigParser.read_file()`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81656)
      - Set filters ``intersect``, ``difference``, ``symmetric_difference`` and ``union``
        now always return a ``list``, never a ``set``. Previously, a ``set`` would
        be returned if the inputs were a hashable type such as ``str``, instead of
        a collection, such as a ``list`` or ``tuple``.
      - Set filters ``intersect``, ``difference``, ``symmetric_difference`` and ``union``
        now use set operations when the given items are hashable. Previously, list
        operations were performed unless the inputs were a hashable type such as ``str``,
        instead of a collection, such as a ``list`` or ``tuple``.
      - Switch result queue from a ``multiprocessing.queues.Queue` to ``multiprocessing.queues.SimpleQueue``,
        primarily to allow properly handling pickling errors, to prevent an infinite
        hang waiting for task results
      - The ``ansible-config init`` command now has a documentation description.
      - The ``ansible-galaxy collection download`` command now has a documentation
        description.
      - The ``ansible-galaxy collection install`` command documentation is now visible
        (previously hidden by a decorator).
      - The ``ansible-galaxy collection verify`` command now has a documentation description.
      - The ``ansible-galaxy role install`` command documentation is now visible (previously
        hidden by a decorator).
      - The ``ansible-inventory`` command command now has a documentation description
        (previously used as the epilog).
      - The ``hostname`` module now also updates both current and permanent hostname
        on OpenBSD. Before it only updated the permanent hostname (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80520).
      - Update module_utils.urls unit test to work with cryptography >= 41.0.0.
      - When generating man pages, use ``func`` to find the command function instead
        of looking it up by the command name.
      - '``StrategyBase._process_pending_results`` - create a ``Templar`` on demand
        for templating ``changed_when``/``failed_when``.'
      - '``ansible-galaxy`` now considers all collection paths when identifying which
        collection requirements are already installed. Use the ``COLLECTIONS_PATHS``
        and ``COLLECTIONS_SCAN_SYS_PATHS`` config options to modify these. Previously
        only the install path was considered when resolving the candidates. The install
        path will remain the only one potentially modified. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79767,
        https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81163)'
      - '``ansible.module_utils.service`` - ensure binary data transmission in ``daemonize()``'
      - '``ansible.module_utils.service`` - fix inter-process communication in ``daemonize()``'
      - '``pkg_mgr`` - fix the default dnf version detection'
      - ansiballz - Prevent issue where the time on the control host could change
        part way through building the ansiballz file, potentially causing a pre-1980
        date to be used during ansiballz unpacking leading to a zip file error (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80089)
      - ansible terminal color settings were incorrectly limited to 16 options via
        'choices', removing so all 256 can be accessed.
      - ansible-console - fix filtering by collection names when a collection search
        path was set (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81450).
      - ansible-galaxy - Enabled the ``data`` tarfile filter during role installation
        for Python versions that support it. A probing mechanism is used to avoid
        Python versions with a broken implementation.
      - ansible-galaxy - Fix issue installing collections containing directories with
        more than 100 characters on python versions before 3.10.6
      - ansible-galaxy - Fix variable type error when installing subdir collections
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80943)
      - ansible-galaxy - fix installing collections from directories that have a trailing
        path separator (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77803).
      - ansible-galaxy - fix installing signed collections (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80648).
      - ansible-galaxy - reduce API calls to servers by fetching signatures only for
        final candidates.
      - ansible-galaxy - started allowing the use of pre-releases for collections
        that do not have any stable versions published. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81606)
      - ansible-galaxy - started allowing the use of pre-releases for dependencies
        on any level of the dependency tree that specifically demand exact pre-release
        versions of collections and not version ranges. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81606)
      - ansible-galaxy collection verify - fix verifying signed collections when the
        keyring is not configured.
      - ansible-test - Add support for ``argcomplete`` version 3.
      - ansible-test - All containers created by ansible-test now include the current
        test session ID in their name. This avoids conflicts between concurrent ansible-test
        invocations using the same container host.
      - ansible-test - Always use ansible-test managed entry points for ansible-core
        CLI tools when not running from source. This fixes issues where CLI entry
        points created during install are not compatible with ansible-test.
      - ansible-test - Fix a traceback that occurs when attempting to test Ansible
        source using a different ansible-test. A clear error message is now given
        when this scenario occurs.

      - ansible-test - Fix several possible tracebacks when using the ``-e`` option
        with sanity tests.
      - ansible-test - Fix various cases where the test timeout could expire without
        terminating the tests.
      - ansible-test - Pre-build a PyYAML wheel before installing requirements to
        avoid a potential Cython build failure.
      - ansible-test - Remove redundant warning about missing programs before attempting
        to execute them.
      - ansible-test - The ``import`` sanity test now checks the collection loader
        for remote-only Python support when testing ansible-core.
      - ansible-test - Unit tests now report warnings generated during test runs.
        Previously only warnings generated during test collection were reported.
      - ansible-test - Update ``pylint`` to 2.17.2 to resolve several possible false
        positives.
      - ansible-test - Update ``pylint`` to 2.17.3 to resolve several possible false
        positives.
      - ansible-test - Use ``raise ... from ...`` when raising exceptions from within
        an exception handler.
      - ansible-test - When bootstrapping remote FreeBSD instances, use the OS packaged
        ``setuptools`` instead of installing the latest version from PyPI.
      - ansible-test local change detection - use ``git merge-base <branch> HEAD``
        instead of ``git merge-base --fork-point <branch>`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79734).
      - ansible-vault - fail when the destination file location is not writable before
        performing encryption (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81455).
      - apt - ignore fail_on_autoremove and allow_downgrade parameters when using
        aptitude (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77868).
      - blockinfile - avoid crash with Python 3 if creating the directory fails when
        ``create=true`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81662).
      - connection timeouts defined in ansible.cfg will now be properly used, the
        --timeout cli option was obscuring them by always being set.
      - copy - print correct destination filename when using `content` and `--diff`
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79749).
      - copy unit tests - Fixing "dir all perms" documentation and formatting for
        easier reading.
      - core will now also look at the connection plugin to force 'local' interpreter
        for networking path compatibility as just ansible_network_os could be misleading.
      - deb822_repository - use http-agent for receiving content (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80809).
      - debconf - idempotency in questions with type 'password' (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/47676).
      - distribution facts - fix Source Mage family mapping
      - dnf - fix a failure when a package from URI was specified and ``update_only``
        was set (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81376).
      - dnf5 - Update dnf5 module to handle API change for setting the download directory
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80887)
      - dnf5 - Use ``transaction.check_gpg_signatures`` API call to check package
        signatures AND possibly to recover from when keys are missing.
      - dnf5 - fix module and package names in the message following failed module
        respawn attempt
      - dnf5 - use the logs API to determine transaction problems
      - dpkg_selections - check if the package exists before performing the selection
        operation (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81404).
      - encrypt - deprecate passlib_or_crypt API (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/55839).
      - fetch - Handle unreachable errors properly (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/27816)
      - file modules - Make symbolic modes with X use the computed permission, not
        original file (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80128)
      - file modules - fix validating invalid symbolic modes.
      - first found lookup has been updated to use the normalized argument parsing
        (pythonic) matching the documented examples.
      - first found lookup, fixed an issue with subsequent items clobbering information
        from previous ones.
      - first_found lookup now gets 'untemplated' loop entries and handles templating
        itself as task_executor was removing even 'templatable' entries and breaking
        functionality. https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70772
      - galaxy - check if the target for symlink exists (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81586).
      - galaxy - cross check the collection type and collection source (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79463).
      - gather_facts parallel option was doing the reverse of what was stated, now
        it does run modules in parallel when True and serially when False.
      - handlers - fix ``v2_playbook_on_notify`` callback not being called when notifying
        handlers
      - handlers - the ``listen`` keyword can affect only one handler with the same
        name, the last one defined as it is a case with the ``notify`` keyword (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81013)
      - include_role - expose variables from parent roles to role's handlers (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80459)
      - inventory_ini - handle SyntaxWarning while parsing ini file in inventory (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81457).
      - iptables - remove default rule creation when creating iptables chain to be
        more similar to the command line utility (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80256).
      - lib/ansible/utils/encrypt.py - remove unused private ``_LOCK`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81613)
      - lookup/url.py - Fix incorrect var/env/ini entry for `force_basic_auth`
      - man page build - Remove the dependency on the ``docs`` directory for building
        man pages.
      - man page build - Sub commands of ``ansible-galaxy role`` and ``ansible-galaxy
        collection`` are now documented.
      - module responses - Ensure that module responses are utf-8 adhereing to JSON
        RFC and expectations of the core code.
      - module/role argument spec - validate the type for options that are None when
        the option is required or has a non-None default (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79656).
      - modules/user.py - Add check for valid directory when creating new user homedir
        (allows /dev/null as skeleton) (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75063)
      - paramiko_ssh, psrp, and ssh connection plugins - ensure that all values for
        options that should be strings are actually converted to strings (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81029).
      - password_hash - fix salt format for ``crypt``  (only used if ``passlib`` is
        not installed) for the ``bcrypt`` algorithm.
      - pep517 build backend - Copy symlinks when copying the source tree. This avoids
        tracebacks in various scenarios, such as when a venv is present in the source
        tree.
      - pep517 build backend - Use the documented ``import_module`` import from ``importlib``.
      - pip module - Update module to prefer use of the python ``packaging`` and ``importlib.metadata``
        modules due to ``pkg_resources`` being deprecated (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80488)
      - pkg_mgr.py - Fix `ansible_pkg_mgr` incorrect in TencentOS Server Linux
      - pkg_mgr.py - Fix `ansible_pkg_mgr` is unknown in Kylin Linux (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81332)
      - powershell modules - Only set an rc of 1 if the PowerShell pipeline signaled
        an error occurred AND there are error records present. Previously it would
        do so only if the error signal was present without checking the error count.
      - replace - handle exception when bad escape character is provided in replace
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79364).
      - role deduplication - don't deduplicate before a role has had a task run for
        that particular host (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81486).
      - service module, does not permanently configure flags flags on Openbsd when
        enabling/disabling a service.
      - service module, enable/disable is not a exclusive action in checkmode anymore.
      - setup gather_timeout - Fix timeout in get_mounts_facts for linux.
      - setup module (fact gathering) will now try to be smarter about different versions
        of facter emitting error when --puppet flag is used w/o puppet.
      - syntax check - Limit ``--syntax-check`` to ``ansible-playbook`` only, as that
        is the only CLI affected by this argument (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80506)
      - tarfile - handle data filter deprecation warning message for extract and extractall
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80832).
      - template - Fix for formatting issues when a template path contains valid jinja/strftime
        pattern (especially line break one) and using the template path in ansible_managed
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79129)
      - templating - In the template action and lookup, use local jinja2 environment
        overlay overrides instead of mutating the templars environment
      - templating - prevent setting arbitrary attributes on Jinja2 environments via
        Jinja2 overrides in templates
      - templating escape and single var optimization now use correct delimiters when
        custom ones are provided either via task or template header.
      - unarchive - fix unarchiving sources that are copied to the remote node using
        a relative temporory directory path (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80710).
      - uri - fix search for JSON type to include complex strings containing '+'
      - urls.py - fixed cert_file and key_file parameters when running on Python 3.12
        - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80490
      - user - set expiration value correctly when unable to retrieve the current
        value from the system (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71916)
      - validate-modules sanity test - replace semantic markup parsing and validating
        code with the code from `antsibull-docs-parser 0.2.0 <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-parser/releases/tag/0.2.0>`__
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/80406).
      - vars_prompt - internally convert the ``unsafe`` value to ``bool``
      - vault and unvault filters now properly take ``vault_id`` parameter.
      - win_fetch - Add support for using file with wildcards in file name. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73128)
      deprecated_features:
      - Deprecated ini config option ``collections_paths``, use the singular form
        ``collections_path`` instead
      - Deprecated the env var ``ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS``, use the singular form
        ``ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH`` instead
      - Support for Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 has been removed as the support
        end of life from Microsoft is October 10th 2023. These versions of Windows
        will no longer be tested in this Ansible release and it cannot be guaranteed
        that they will continue to work going forward.
      - '``STRING_CONVERSION_ACTION`` config option is deprecated as it is no longer
        used in the Ansible Core code base.'
      - the 'smart' option for setting a connection plugin is being removed as it's
        main purpose (choosing between ssh and paramiko) is now irrelevant.
      - vault and unfault filters - the undocumented ``vaultid`` parameter is deprecated
        and will be removed in ansible-core 2.20. Use ``vault_id`` instead.
      - yum_repository - deprecated parameter 'keepcache' (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78693).
      known_issues:
      - ansible-galaxy - dies in the middle of installing a role when that role contains
        Java inner classes (files with $ in the file name).  This is by design, to
        exclude temporary or backup files. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81553).
      - ansible-test - The ``pep8`` sanity test is unable to detect f-string spacing
        issues (E201, E202) on Python 3.10 and 3.11. They are correctly detected under
        Python 3.12. See (https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/1190).
      minor_changes:
      - Add Python type hints to the Display class (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80841)
      - Add ``GALAXY_COLLECTIONS_PATH_WARNING`` option to disable the warning given
        by ``ansible-galaxy collection install`` when installing a collection to a
        path that isn't in the configured collection paths.
      - Add ``python3.12`` to the default ``INTERPRETER_PYTHON_FALLBACK`` list.
      - Add ``utcfromtimestamp`` and ``utcnow`` to ``ansible.module_utils.compat.datetime``
        to return fixed offset datetime objects.
      - Add a general ``GALAXY_SERVER_TIMEOUT`` config option for distribution servers
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79833).
      - Added Python type annotation to connection plugins
      - CLI argument parsing - Automatically prepend to the help of CLI arguments
        that support being specified multiple times. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/22396)
      - DEFAULT_TRANSPORT now defaults to 'ssh', the old 'smart' option is being deprecated
        as versions of OpenSSH without control persist are basically not present anymore.
      - Documentation for set filters ``intersect``, ``difference``, ``symmetric_difference``
        and ``union`` now states that the returned list items are in arbitrary order.
      - Record ``removal_date`` in runtime metadata as a string instead of a date.
      - Remove the ``CleansingNodeVisitor`` class and its usage due to the templating
        changes that made it superfluous. Also simplify the ``Conditional`` class.
      - Removed ``exclude`` and ``recursive-exclude`` commands for generated files
        from the ``MANIFEST.in`` file. These excludes were unnecessary since releases
        are expected to be built with a clean worktree.
      - Removed ``exclude`` commands for sanity test files from the ``MANIFEST.in``
        file. These tests were previously excluded because they did not pass when
        run from an sdist. However, sanity tests are not expected to pass from an
        sdist, so excluding some (but not all) of the failing tests makes little sense.
      - Removed redundant ``include`` commands from the ``MANIFEST.in`` file. These
        includes either duplicated default behavior or another command.
      - The ``ansible-core`` sdist no longer contains pre-generated man pages. Instead,
        a ``packaging/cli-doc/build.py`` script is included in the sdist. This script
        can generate man pages and standalone RST documentation for ``ansible-core``
        CLI programs.
      - The ``docs`` and ``examples`` directories are no longer included in the ``ansible-core``
        sdist. These directories have been moved to the https://github.com/ansible/ansible-documentation
        repository.
      - The minimum required ``setuptools`` version is now 66.1.0, as it is the oldest
        version to support Python 3.12.
      - Update ``ansible_service_mgr`` fact to include init system for SMGL OS family
      - Use ``ansible.module_utils.common.text.converters`` instead of ``ansible.module_utils._text``.
      - Use ``importlib.resources.abc.TraversableResources`` instead of deprecated
        ``importlib.abc.TraversableResources`` where available (https:/github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81082).
      - Use ``include`` where ``recursive-include`` is unnecessary in the ``MANIFEST.in``
        file.
      - Use ``package_data`` instead of ``include_package_data`` for ``setup.cfg``
        to avoid ``setuptools`` warnings.
      - Utilize gpg check provided internally by the ``transaction.run`` method as
        oppose to calling it manually.
      - '``Templar`` - do not add the ``dict`` constructor to ``globals`` as all required
        Jinja2 versions already do so'
      - ansible-doc - allow to filter listing of collections and metadata dump by
        more than one collection (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81450).
      - ansible-galaxy - Add a plural option to improve ignoring multiple signature
        error status codes when installing or verifying collections. A space-separated
        list of error codes can follow --ignore-signature-status-codes in addition
        to specifying --ignore-signature-status-code multiple times (for example,
        ``--ignore-signature-status-codes NO_PUBKEY UNEXPECTED``).
      - ansible-galaxy - Remove internal configuration argument ``v3`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/80721)
      - ansible-galaxy - add note to the collection dependency resolver error message
        about pre-releases if ``--pre`` was not provided (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80048).
      - ansible-galaxy - used to crash out with a "Errno 20 Not a directory" error
        when extracting files from a role when hitting a file with an illegal name
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81553). Now it gives a warning identifying
        the culprit file and the rule violation (e.g., ``my$class.jar`` has a ``$``
        in the name) before crashing out, giving the user a chance to remove the invalid
        file and try again. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81555).

        ``get_exception`` usage.
      - ansible-test - The ``replace-urlopen`` sanity test is now limited to plugins
        in collections. Previously any Python file in a collection was checked for

        value.
      - display methods for warning and deprecation are now proxied to main process

        was added.
      - dnf5 - enable now implemented ``cacheonly`` functionality

        file with an invalid format - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81901
      - ansible-inventory - index available_hosts for major performance boost when
        dumping large inventories
      - ansible-test - Add a ``pylint`` plugin to work around a known issue on Python
        3.12.
      - ansible-test - Include missing ``pylint`` requirements for Python 3.10.
      - ansible-test - Update ``pylint`` to version 3.0.1.
      deprecated_features:
      - Old style vars plugins which use the entrypoints `get_host_vars` or `get_group_vars`
        are deprecated. The plugin should be updated to inherit from `BaseVarsPlugin`
        and define a `get_vars` method as the entrypoint.
      minor_changes:
      - ansible-test - Make Python 3.12 the default version used in the ``base`` and
        ``default`` containers.

  2.16.1rc1:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - assert - Nested templating may result in an inability for the conditional
        to be evaluated. See the porting guide for more information.
      bugfixes:
      - Fix issue where an ``include_tasks`` handler in a role was not able to locate
        a file in ``tasks/`` when ``tasks_from`` was used as a role entry point and
        ``main.yml`` was not present (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82241)
      - Plugin loader does not dedupe nor cache filter/test plugins by file basename,
        but full path name.
      - Restoring the ability of filters/tests can have same file base name but different
        tests/filters defined inside.
      - ansible-pull now will expand relative paths for the ``-d|--directory`` option
        is now expanded before use.
      - ansible-pull will now correctly handle become and connection password file
        options for ansible-playbook.
      - flush_handlers - properly handle a handler failure in a nested block when
        ``force_handlers`` is set (http://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81532)
      - module no_log will no longer affect top level booleans, for example ``no_log_module_parameter='a'``
        will no longer hide ``changed=False`` as a 'no log value' (matches 'a').
      - role params now have higher precedence than host facts again, matching documentation,
        this had unintentionally changed in 2.15.
      - wait_for should not handle 'non mmapable files' again.
