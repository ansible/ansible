      breaking_changes:
      - assert - Nested templating may result in an inability for the conditional
        to be evaluated. See the porting guide for more information.
      bugfixes:
      - All core lookups now use set_option(s) even when doing their own custom parsing.
        This ensures that the options are always the proper type.
      - Allow for searching handler subdir for included task via include_role (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81722)
      - AnsibleModule.atomic_move - fix preserving extended ACLs of the destination
        when it exists (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/72929).
      - Cache host_group_vars after instantiating it once and limit the amount of
        repetitive work it needs to do every time it runs.
      - Call PluginLoader.all() once for vars plugins, and load vars plugins that
        run automatically or are enabled specifically by name subsequently.
      - Consolidate systemd detection logic into one place (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80975).
      - Consolidated the list of internal static vars, centralized them as constant
        and completed from some missing entries.
      - Do not print undefined error message twice (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78703).
      - Enable file cache for vaulted files during vars lookup to fix a strong performance
        penalty in huge and complex playbboks.
      - Fix NEVRA parsing of package names that include digit(s) in them (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76463,
        https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81018)
      - Fix ``force_handlers`` not working with ``any_errors_fatal`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/36308)

      - 'Fix an issue when setting a plugin name from an unsafe source resulted in
        ``ValueError: unmarshallable object`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82708)'
      - Fix check for missing _sub_plugin attribute in older connection plugins (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/82954)
      - Fix condition for unquoting configuration strings from ini files (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82387).
      - Fix for when ``any_errors_fatal`` was ignored if error occurred in a block
        with always (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/31543)
      - Fix handling missing urls in ansible.module_utils.urls.fetch_file for Python
        3.
      - Fix issue where an ``include_tasks`` handler in a role was not able to locate
        a file in ``tasks/`` when ``tasks_from`` was used as a role entry point and
        ``main.yml`` was not present (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82241)
      - Fix issues when tasks withing nested blocks wouldn't run when ``force_handlers``
        is set (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81533)
      - Fix loading vars_plugins in roles (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82239).
      - 'Fix notifying role handlers by listen keyword topics with the "role_name
        : " prefix (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82849).'
      - Fix setting proper locale for git executable when running on non english systems,
        ensuring git output can always be parsed.
      - Fix tasks in always section not being executed for nested blocks with ``any_errors_fatal``
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73246)
      - Fixes permission for cache json file from 600 to 644 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82683).
      - Give the tombstone error for ``include`` pre-fork like other tombstoned action/module
        plugins.

        message (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80561).
      - Remove the galaxy_info field ``platforms`` from the role templates (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82453).
      - Restoring the ability of filters/tests can have same file base name but different
        tests/filters defined inside.

        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82514).
      - Run all handlers with the same ``listen`` topic, even when notified from another
        handler (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82363).
      - Slight optimization to hostvars (instantiate template only once per host,
        vs per call to var).
      - Stopped misleadingly advertising ``async`` mode support in the ``reboot``
        module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71517).
      - '``ansible-galaxy role import`` - fix using the ``role_name`` in a standalone
        role''s ``galaxy_info`` metadata by disabling automatic removal of the ``ansible-role-``
        prefix. This matches the behavior of the Galaxy UI which also no longer implicitly
        removes the ``ansible-role-`` prefix. Use the ``--role-name`` option or add
        a ``role_name`` to the ``galaxy_info`` dictionary in the role''s ``meta/main.yml``
        to use an alternate role name.'
      - '``ansible-test sanity --test runtime-metadata`` - add ``action_plugin`` as
        a valid field for modules in the schema (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/82562).'

      - '``any_errors_fatal`` should fail all hosts and rescue all of them when a
        ``rescue`` section is specified (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80981)'
      - '``include_role`` - properly execute ``v2_playbook_on_include`` and ``v2_runner_on_failed``
        callbacks as well as increase ``ok`` and ``failed`` stats in the play recap,
        when appropriate (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77336)'
      - allow_duplicates - fix evaluating if the current role allows duplicates instead
        of using the initial value from the duplicate's cached role.
      - ansible-config init will now dedupe ini entries from plugins.
      - ansible-galaxy - Deprecate use of the Galaxy v2 API (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81781)

      - ansible-galaxy - started allowing the use of pre-releases for dependencies
        on any level of the dependency tree that specifically demand exact pre-release
        versions of collections and not version ranges. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81606)
      - ansible-galaxy error on dependency resolution will not error itself due to
        'virtual' collections not having a name/namespace.
      - ansible-galaxy info - fix reporting no role found when lookup_role_by_name
        returns None.
      - ansible-galaxy role import - exit with 1 when the import fails (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82175).
      - ansible-galaxy role install - fix installing roles from Galaxy that have version
        ``None`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81832).
      - ansible-galaxy role install - fix symlinks (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82702,
        https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81965).
      - ansible-galaxy role install - normalize tarfile paths and symlinks using ``ansible.utils.path.unfrackpath``

      - ansible-test - Add a ``pylint`` plugin to work around a known issue on Python
        3.12.
      - ansible-test - Explicitly supply ``ControlPath=none`` when setting up port
        forwarding over SSH to address the scenario where the local ssh configuration
        uses ``ControlPath`` for all hosts, and would prevent ports to be forwarded
        after the initial connection to the host.
      - ansible-test - Fix parsing of cgroup entries which contain a ``:`` in the
        path (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81977).
      - ansible-test - Include missing ``pylint`` requirements for Python 3.10.
      - ansible-test - Properly detect docker host when using ``ssh://`` protocol
        for connecting to the docker daemon.
      - ansible-test - The ``libexpat`` package is automatically upgraded during remote
        bootstrapping to maintain compatibility with newer Python packages.
      - ansible-test - The ``validate-modules`` sanity test no longer attempts to
        process files with unrecognized extensions as Python (resolves https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82604).
      - ansible-test - Update ``pylint`` to version 3.0.1.

        for plugin names in collections as an attempted deprecation (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/82575).
      - "ansible-test \u2014 Python 3.8\u20133.12 will use ``coverage`` v7.3.2."
      - ansible.builtin.apt - calling clean = true does not properly clean certain
        cache files such as /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin and /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82611)
      - ansible.builtin.uri - the module was ignoring the ``force`` parameter and
        always requesting a cached copy (via the ``If-Modified-Since`` header) when
        downloading to an existing local file. Disable caching when ``force`` is ``true``,
        as documented (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82166).
      - apt - honor install_recommends and dpkg_options while installing python3-apt
        library (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/40608).
      - apt - install recommended packages when installing package via deb file (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/29726).

        False`` was set as a task attribute - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82811'
      - blockinfile - when ``create=true`` is used with a filename without path, the
        module crashed (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81638).
      - check if there are attributes to set before attempting to set them (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76727)
      - copy action now also generates temprary files as hidden ('.' prefixed) to
        avoid accidental pickup by running services that glob by extension.
      - copy action now ensures that tempfiles use the same suffix as destination,
        to allow for ``validate`` to work with utilities that check extensions.

      - dnf - fix an issue when installing a package by specifying a file it provides
        could result in installing a different package providing the same file than
        the package already installed resulting in resolution failure (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82461)
      - dnf - properly set gpg check options on enabled repositories according to
        the ``disable_gpg_check`` option (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80110)
      - dnf - properly skip unavailable packages when ``skip_broken`` is enabled (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80590)
      - dnf - the ``nobest`` option only overrides the distribution default when explicitly
        used, and is used for all supported operations (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82616)
      - dnf5 - respect ``allow_downgrade`` when installing packages directly from
        rpm files
      - dnf5 - the ``nobest`` option only overrides the distribution default when

      - dwim functions for lookups should be better at detectging role context even
        in abscense of tasks/main.
      - expect - fix argument spec error using timeout=null (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80982).
      - fact gathering on linux now handles thread count by using rounding vs dropping

        being removed.
      - module no_log will no longer affect top level booleans, for example ``no_log_module_parameter='a'``

      - moved assemble, raw, copy, fetch, reboot, script and wait_for_connection to
        query task instead of play_context ensuring they get the lastest and most
        correct data.
      - reboot action now handles connections with 'timeout' vs only 'connection_timeout'
        settings.
      - role params now have higher precedence than host facts again, matching documentation,
        this had unintentionally changed in 2.15.
      - roles, code cleanup and performance optimization of dependencies, now cached,  and
        ``public`` setting is now determined once, at role instantiation.

        an invalid type in Python (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82600).
      - template action will also inherit the behavior from copy (as it uses it internally).
      - templating - ensure syntax errors originating from a template being compiled
        into Python code object result in a failure (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82606)
      - unarchive - add support for 8 character permission strings for zip archives
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81705).

        index from ``AnsibleUnsafeBytes``
      - unsafe data - Address an incompatibility with ``AnsibleUnsafeText`` and ``AnsibleUnsafeBytes``

        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82414)
      - uri action plugin now skipped during check mode (not supported) instead of
        even trying to execute the module, which already skipped, this does not really
        change the result, but returns much faster.
      - vars - handle exception while combining VarsWithSources and dict (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81659).
      - wait_for should not handle 'non mmapable files' again.
      - winrm - Better handle send input failures when communicating with hosts under
        load
      - winrm - Do not raise another exception during cleanup when a task is timed
        out - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81095
      - winrm - does not hang when attempting to get process output when stdin write
        failed
      deprecated_features:
      - Old style vars plugins which use the entrypoints `get_host_vars` or `get_group_vars`
        are deprecated. The plugin should be updated to inherit from `BaseVarsPlugin`
        and define a `get_vars` method as the entrypoint.
      - The 'required' parameter in 'ansible.module_utils.common.process.get_bin_path'
        API is deprecated (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82464).
      - '``module_utils`` - importing the following convenience helpers from ``ansible.module_utils.basic``
        has been deprecated: ``get_exception``, ``literal_eval``, ``_literal_eval``,
        ``datetime``, ``signal``, ``types``, ``chain``, ``repeat``, ``PY2``, ``PY3``,
        ``b``, ``binary_type``, ``integer_types``, ``iteritems``, ``string_types``,
        ``test_type``, ``map`` and ``shlex_quote``.'
      - ansible-doc - role entrypoint attributes are deprecated and eventually will
        no longer be shown in ansible-doc from ansible-core 2.20 on (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82639,
        https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/82678).
      - paramiko connection plugin, configuration items in the global scope are being
        deprecated and will be removed in favor or the existing same options in the
        plugin itself. Users should not need to change anything (how to configure
        them are the same) but plugin authors using the global constants should move
        to using the plugin's get_option().
      major_changes:
      - urls.py - Removed support for Python 2
      minor_changes:
      - Add ``dump`` and ``passno`` mount information to facts component (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80478)
      - Added MIRACLE LINUX 9.2 in RedHat OS Family.
      - Interpreter Discovery - Remove hardcoded references to specific python interpreters
        to use for certain distro versions, and modify logic for python3 to become
        the default.
      - Use Python's built-in ``functools.update_wrapper`` instead an inline copy
        from Python 3.7.
      - User can now set ansible.log to record higher verbosity than what is specified
        for display via new configuration item LOG_VERBOSITY.
      - '``DEFAULT_PRIVATE_ROLE_VARS`` is now overridden by explicit setting of ``public``
        for ``include_roles`` and ``import_roles``.'
      - '``ansible-galaxy role|collection init`` - accept ``--extra-vars`` to supplement/override
        the variables ``ansible-galaxy`` injects for templating ``.j2`` files in the
        skeleton.'
      - '``import_role`` action now also gets a ``public`` option that controls variable
        exports,  default depending on ``DEFAULT_PRIVATE_ROLE_VARS`` (if using defaults
        equates to ``public=True``).'
      - added configuration item ``TARGET_LOG_INFO`` that allows the user/author to
        add an information string to the log output on targets.
      - ansible-doc - treat double newlines in documentation strings as paragraph
        breaks. This is useful to create multi-paragraph notes in module/plugin documentation
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/82465).
      - ansible-doc output has been revamped to make it more visually pleasing when
        going to a terminal, also more concise, use -v to show extra information.
      - ansible-galaxy - Started normalizing build directory with a trailing separator
        when building collections, internally. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81619).
      - ansible-galaxy dependency resolution messages have changed the unexplained
        'virtual' collection for the specific type ('scm', 'dir', etc) that is more
        user friendly
      - ansible-test - Add Alpine 3.19 container.
      - ansible-test - Add Alpine 3.19 to remotes.
      - ansible-test - Add Fedora 39 container.
      - ansible-test - Add Fedora 39 remote.
      - ansible-test - Add a work-around for permission denied errors when using ``pytest
        >= 8`` on multi-user systems with an installed version of ``ansible-test``.
      - ansible-test - Add support for RHEL 9.3 remotes.
      - ansible-test - Added a macOS 14.3 remote VM.
      - ansible-test - Bump the ``nios-test-container`` from version 2.0.0 to version
        3.0.0.
      - ansible-test - Containers and remotes managed by ansible-test will have their
        Python ``EXTERNALLY-MANAGED`` marker (PEP668) removed. This provides backwards
        compatibility for existing tests running in newer environments which mark
        their Python as externally managed. A future version of ansible-test may change
        this behavior, requiring tests to be adapted to such environments.
      - ansible-test - Make Python 3.12 the default version used in the ``base`` and
        ``default`` containers.
      - ansible-test - Remove Alpine 3(.18) container.
      - ansible-test - Remove Alpine 3.18 from remotes.
      - ansible-test - Remove Fedora 38 remote support.
      - ansible-test - Remove Fedora 38 test container.
      - ansible-test - Remove rhel/9.2 test remote
      - ansible-test - Remove the FreeBSD 13.2 remote.
      - ansible-test - Removed fallback to ``virtualenv`` when ``-m venv`` is non-functional.
      - 'ansible-test - Removed test remotes: macos/13.2'
      - ansible-test - Removed the ``no-basestring`` sanity test. The test is no longer
        necessary now that Python 3 is required.
      - ansible-test - Removed the ``no-dict-iteritems``, ``no-dict-iterkeys`` and
        ``no-dict-itervalues`` sanity tests. The tests are no longer necessary since
        Python 3 is required.
      - ansible-test - Removed the ``no-main-display`` sanity test. The unwanted pattern
        is unlikely to occur, since the test has existed since Ansible 2.8.
      - ansible-test - Removed the ``no-unicode-literals`` sanity test. The test is
        unnecessary now that Python 3 is required and the ``unicode_literals`` feature
        has no effect.
      - ansible-test - Special handling for installation of ``cryptography`` has been
        removed, as it is no longer necessary.
      - ansible-test - The ``shellcheck`` sanity test no longer disables the ``SC2164``
        check. In most cases, seeing this error means the script is missing ``set
        -e``.
      - ansible-test - The ``unidiomatic-typecheck`` rule has been enabled in the
        ``pylint`` sanity test.
      - ansible-test - The ``unidiomatic-typecheck`` rule has been removed from the
        ``validate-modules`` sanity test.
      - ansible-test - Update the base and default containers to use Ubuntu 22.04
        for the base image. This also updates PowerShell to version 7.4.0 with .NET
        8.0.0 and ShellCheck to version 0.8.0.
      - ansible-test - Updated the CloudStack test container to version 1.7.0.
      - ansible-test - Updated the distro test containers to version 6.3.0 to include
        coverage 7.3.2 for Python 3.8+. The alpine3 container is now based on 3.18
        instead of 3.17 and includes Python 3.11 instead of Python 3.10.
      - ansible-test - Updated the distro test containers to version 7.1.0.
      - ansible-test - When ansible-test installs requirements, it now instructs pip
        to allow installs on externally managed environments as defined by PEP 668.
        This only occurs in ephemeral environments managed by ansible-test, such as
        containers, or when the `--requirements` option is used.
      - ansible-test - When invoking ``sleep`` in containers during container setup,
        the ``env`` command is used to avoid invoking the shell builtin, if present.
      - ansible-test - document block name now included in error message for YAML
        parsing errors (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82353).
      - ansible-test - sanity test allows ``EXAMPLES`` to be multi-document YAML (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82353).
      - ansible-test now has FreeBSD 13.3 and 14.0 support
      - ansible.builtin.user - Remove user not found warning (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80267)
      - apt_repository.py - use api.launchpad.net endpoint instead of launchpad.net/api
      - async tasks can now also support check mode at the same time.
      - async_status now supports check mode.
      - constructed inventory plugin - Adding a note that only group_vars of explicit
        groups are loaded (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/82580).
      - csvfile - add a keycol parameter to specify in which column to search.
      - dnf - add the ``best`` option
      - dnf5 - add the ``best`` option
      - filter plugin - Add the count and mandatory_count parameters in the regex_replace
        filter
      - find - add a encoding parameter to specify which encoding of the files to
        be searched.
      - git module - gpg_allowlist name was added in 2.17 and we will eventually deprecate
        the gpg_whitelist alias.
      - import_role - allow subdirectories with ``_from`` options for parity with
        ``include_role`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82584).
      - module argument spec - Allow module authors to include arbitrary additional
        context in the argument spec, by making use of a new top level key called
        ``context``. This key should be a dict type. This allows for users to customize
        what they place in the argument spec, without having to ignore sanity tests
        that validate the schema.
      - modules - Add the ability for an action plugin to call ``self._execute_module(*,
        ignore_unknown_opts=True)`` to execute a module with options that may not
        be supported for the version being called. This tells the module basic wrapper
        to ignore validating the options provided match the arg spec.
      - package action now has a configuration that overrides the detected package
        manager, it is still overridden itself by the use option.
      - py3compat - Remove ``ansible.utils.py3compat`` as it is no longer necessary
      - removed the unused argument ``create_new_password`` from ``CLI.build_vault_ids``
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/82066).
      - urls - Add support for TLS 1.3 post handshake certificate authentication -
        https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81782
      - urls - reduce complexity of ``Request.open``
      - user - accept yescrypt hash as user password
      - validate-modules tests now correctly handles ``choices`` in dictionary format.
