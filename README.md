[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ansible/ansible-modules-extras.svg?branch=devel)](https://travis-ci.org/ansible/ansible-modules-extras)

ansible-modules-extras
======================

This repo contains a subset of ansible-modules with slightly lower use or priority than "core" modules.

All new modules should be submitted here, and have a chance to be promoted to core over time.

Reporting bugs
==============

Take care to submit tickets to the appropriate repo where modules are contained. The repo is mentioned at the bottom of module documentation page at [docs.ansible.com](http://docs.ansible.com/).

Testing modules
===============

Ansible [module development guide](http://docs.ansible.com/developing_modules.html#testing-modules) contains the latest info about that.

License
=======

As with Ansible, modules distributed with Ansible are GPLv3 licensed. User generated modules not part of this project can be of any license.

Installation
============

There should be no need to install this repo separately as it should be included in any Ansible install using the official documented methods.
