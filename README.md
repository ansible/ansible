Ansible
=======

Ansible is a radically simple configuration-management, deployment, task-execution, and 
multinode orchestration framework.   

Read all about at it at (http://ansible.github.com)

Design Principles
=================

   * Dead simple setup
   * Super fast & parallel by default
   * No server or client daemons; use existing SSHd
   * No additional software required on client boxes
   * Modules can be written in ANY language
   * Awesome API for creating very powerful distributed scripts
   * Be usable as non-root
   * The easiest config management system to use, ever.

Get Involved
============

   * [ansible-project mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ansible-project)
   * irc.freenode.net: #ansible

Patch Instructions
==================

Contributions to the core and modules are greatly welcome.

   * Required Process:
       * Submit github pull requests to the "ansible/devel" branch for features
       * Fixes for bugs may be submitted to "ansible/master"
       * Make sure "make tests" passes before submitting any requests.
   * Bonus points:
       * Joining the mailing list
       * Using squash merges
       * Updating the "rst/*" files in the docs project and "docs/" manpage content
       * Adding more unit tests 
   * Avoid:
       * Sending patches to the mailing list directly.
       * Sending feature pull requests to the 'master' branch instead of the devel branch
       * Sending pull requests to mpdehaan's personal ansible fork.
