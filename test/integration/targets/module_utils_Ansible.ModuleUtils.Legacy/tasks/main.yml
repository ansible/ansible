# NB: these tests are just a placeholder until we have pester unit tests.
# They are being run as part of the Windows smoke tests. Please do not significantly
# increase the size of these tests, as the smoke tests need to remain fast.
# Any significant additions should be made to the (as yet nonexistent) PS module_utils unit tests.
