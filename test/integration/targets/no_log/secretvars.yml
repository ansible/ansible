# Unique values are used for each secret below to ensure that one secret "learned" does not cause another non-secret
# value to be considered secret simply because they share the same value. A common substring is, however, present in
# each one to simplify searching for secret values in test output. Having a unique value for each also helps in
# debugging when unexpected output is encountered.
