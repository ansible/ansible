# VERIFY MODE
# can't set file mode on windows so commenting this test out
#- name: set file mode
#  win_file: path={{win_output_dir}}/foo.templated mode=0644
#  register: file_result

#- name: ensure file mode did not change
#  assert:
#    that:
#      - "file_result.changed != True"

# commenting out all the following tests as expanduser and file modes not windows concepts.

# VERIFY dest as a directory does not break file attributes
# Note: expanduser is needed to go down the particular codepath that was broken before
#- name: setup directory for test
#  win_file: state=directory dest={{win_output_dir | expanduser}}/template-dir mode=0755 owner=nobody group=root

#- name: set file mode when the destination is a directory
#  win_template: src=foo.j2 dest={{win_output_dir | expanduser}}/template-dir/ mode=0600 owner=root group=root

#- name: set file mode when the destination is a directory
#  win_template: src=foo.j2 dest={{win_output_dir | expanduser}}/template-dir/ mode=0600 owner=root group=root
#  register: file_result
#
#- name: check that the file has the correct attributes
#  win_stat: path={{win_output_dir | expanduser}}/template-dir/foo.j2
#  register: file_attrs
#
#- assert:
#    that:
#      - "file_attrs.stat.uid == 0"
#      - "file_attrs.stat.pw_name == 'root'"
#      - "file_attrs.stat.mode == '0600'"
#
#- name: check that the containing directory did not change attributes
#  win_stat: path={{win_output_dir | expanduser}}/template-dir/
#  register: dir_attrs
#
#- assert:
#    that:
#      - "dir_attrs.stat.uid != 0"
