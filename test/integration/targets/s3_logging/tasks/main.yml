# Integration tests for s3_logging
#
# Notes:
# - s3_logging doesn't support check_mode and the only output is 'changed'
# - During initial testing we hit issues with boto reporting
#   "You must give the log-delivery group WRITE and READ_ACP permissions
#   to the target bucket"
#   a long term solution might be to port s3_logging to AnsibleAWSModule
#   so we can add retries
#
