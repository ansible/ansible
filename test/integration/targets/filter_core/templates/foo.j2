This is a test of various filter plugins found in Ansible (ex: core.py), and
not so much a test of the core filters in Jinja2.

Dumping the same structure to YAML

{{ some_structure | to_nice_yaml }}

Dumping the same structure to JSON, but don't pretty print

{{ some_structure | to_json(sort_keys=true) }}

Dumping the same structure to YAML, but don't pretty print

{{ some_structure | to_yaml }}

From a recorded task, the changed, failed, success, and skipped
tests are shortcuts to ask if those tasks produced changes, failed,
succeeded, or skipped (as one might guess).

Changed = {{ some_registered_var is changed }}
Failed  = {{ some_registered_var is failed }}
Success = {{ some_registered_var is successful }}
Skipped = {{ some_registered_var is skipped }}

The mandatory filter fails if a variable is not defined and returns the value.
To avoid breaking this test, this variable is already defined.

a = {{ a | mandatory }}

There are various casts available

int = {{ a | int }}
bool = {{ 1 | bool }}

String quoting

quoted = {{ 'quoted' | quote }}

The fileglob module returns the list of things matching a pattern.

fileglob = {{ (playbook_dir + '/files/fileglob/*') | fileglob | map('basename') | sort | join(', ') }}

There are also various string operations that work on paths.  These do not require
files to exist and are passthrus to the python os.path functions

/etc/motd with basename = {{ '/etc/motd' | basename }}
/etc/motd with dirname  = {{ '/etc/motd' | dirname }}

path_join_simple = {{ ('/etc', 'subdir', 'test') | path_join }}
path_join_with_slash = {{ ('/etc', 'subdir', '/test') | path_join }}
path_join_relative = {{ ('etc', 'subdir', 'test') | path_join }}

TODO: realpath follows symlinks.  There isn't a test for this just now.

TODO: add tests for set theory operations like union

regex_replace = {{ 'foo' | regex_replace('^foo', 'bar') }}
# Check regex_replace with multiline
{{ '#foo\n#foot' | regex_replace('^#foo', '#bar', multiline=True) }}
regex_search = {{ 'test_value_0001' | regex_search('([0-9]+)$')}}
regex_findall = {{ 'car\ntar\nfoo\nbar\n' | regex_findall('^.ar$', multiline=True)|to_json }}
regex_escape = {{ '^f.*o(.*)$' | regex_escape() }}
