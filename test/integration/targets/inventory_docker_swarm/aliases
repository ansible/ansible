skip/docker  # The tests sometimes make docker daemon unstable; hence,
             # we skip all docker-based CI runs to avoid disrupting
             # the whole CI system. On VMs, we restart docker daemon
             # after finishing the tests to minimize potential effects
             # on other tests.
