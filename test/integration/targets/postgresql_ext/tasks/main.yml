# Initial CI tests of postgresql_ext module.
# pg_extension system view is available from PG 9.1.
# The tests are restricted by Fedora because there will be errors related with
# attempts to change the environment during postgis installation or
# missing postgis package in repositories.
# Anyway, these tests completely depend on Postgres version,
# not specific distributions.

# CI tests of "version" option.
# It uses a mock extension, see test/integration/targets/setup_postgresql_db/.
# TODO: change postgresql_ext_initial.yml to use the mock extension too.
