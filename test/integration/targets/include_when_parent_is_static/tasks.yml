      The playbook should have failed due to a syntax error in 'syntax_error.yml' when attempting a static include of that file.

# perform an include task which should be static if all of the task's parents are static, otherwise it should be dynamic
# this file was loaded using import_tasks, which is static, so this include should also be static
