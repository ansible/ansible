ERROR! the role 'does-not-exist' was not found in TEST_PATH/roles:/<<HOMEDIR>>/.ansible/roles:/usr/share/ansible/roles:/etc/ansible/roles:TEST_PATH

The error appears to be in 'TEST_PATH/test_include_role_fails.yml': line 5, column 15, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

    - include_role:
        name: does-not-exist
              ^ here
