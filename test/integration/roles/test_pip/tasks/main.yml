# FIXME: replace the python test package

# first some tests installed system-wide
# verify things were not installed to start with

- name: ensure a package is not installed (precondition setup)

# verify that a package that is uninstalled being set to absent
# results in an unchanged state and that the test package is not
# installed

- name: ensure a package is not installed

- name: verify {{ pip_test_package }} is not present

# now we're going to install the test package knowing it is uninstalled
# and check that installation was ok
