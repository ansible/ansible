Contributing to Ansible
=======================

Please read the following information to learn how to contribute to this project.

Branch Info
===========

   * The devel branch corresponds to the latest ongoing release
   * Various release-X.Y branches exist for previous releases
   * All feature work happens on the development branch.
   * Major bug fixes will be made to the last release branch only
   * See CHANGELOG.md for release notes to track each release.

Patch Instructions
==================

Contributions to the core and modules are greatly welcome.

   * Required Process:
       * Submit github pull requests to the "ansible/devel" branch for features
       * Fixes for bugs may also be submitted to "ansible/release-X.Y" for the last release
       * Make sure "make tests" passes before submitting any requests.
   * Bonus points:
       * Joining the mailing list
       * Fixing bugs instead of sending bug reports.
       * Using squash merges
       * Updating the "rst/*" files in the docs project and "docs/" manpage content
       * Adding more unit tests
   * Avoid:
       * Sending patches to the mailing list directly.
       * Sending feature pull requests to the 'release' branch instead of the devel branch
       * Sending pull requests to mpdehaan's personal ansible fork.
