module: include_role
short_description: Load and execute a role
description:
  - Dynamically loads and executes a specified role as a task.
  - May be used only where Ansible tasks are allowed - inside C(pre_tasks), C(tasks), or C(post_tasks) play objects, or as a task inside a role.
  - Task-level keywords, loops, and conditionals apply only to the C(include_role) statement itself.
  - To apply keywords to the tasks within the role, pass them using the O(apply) option or use M(ansible.builtin.import_role) instead.
  - Ignores some keywords, like C(until) and C(retries).
  - This module is also supported for Windows targets.
  - Does not work in handlers.
version_added: "2.2"
options:
  apply:
    description:
      - Accepts a hash of task keywords (for example C(tags), C(become)) that will be applied to all tasks within the included role.

    description:
      - This option dictates whether the role's C(vars) and C(defaults) are exposed to the play. If set to V(true)
        the variables will be available to tasks following the C(include_role) task. This functionality differs from
        standard variable exposure for roles listed under the C(roles) header or M(ansible.builtin.import_role) as they are exposed
        to the play at playbook parsing time, and available to earlier roles and tasks as well.

notes:
  - Handlers and are made available to the whole play.
  - After Ansible 2.4, you can use M(ansible.builtin.import_role) for B(static) behaviour and this action for B(dynamic) one.
