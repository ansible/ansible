        To operate on several packages this can accept a comma separated string of packages or a list of packages."
      - Comparison operators for package version are valid here C(>), C(<), C(>=), C(<=). Example - C(name >= 1.0).
        Spaces around the operator are required.

      - Specify if the named package and version is allowed to downgrade
        a maybe already installed higher version of that package.
        Note that setting O(allow_downgrade=true) can make this module
        behave in a non-idempotent way. The task could end up with a set
        of packages that does not match the complete list of specified
        packages to install (because dependencies between the downgraded
        package and others can cause changes to the packages which were
        in the earlier transaction).
    type: bool

    version_added: "2.7"
  install_repoquery:
    description:

    type: bool
    default: "yes"
    version_added: "2.8"

    description:
      - Specifies an alternate directory to store packages.

    required: false
    type: bool
    default: "no"
    version_added: "2.10"
  nobest:
    description:

      - Since ansible-core 2.17 the default value is set by the operating system distribution.
    required: false
    type: bool
    version_added: "2.11"
  best:
    description:
      - When set to V(true), either use a package with the highest version available or fail.

  cacheonly:
    description:
      - Tells dnf to run entirely from system cache; does not download or update metadata.
    type: bool
    default: "no"
    version_added: "2.12"
extends_documentation_fragment:

attributes:
    action:
        details: dnf has 2 action plugins that use it under the hood, M(ansible.builtin.dnf) and M(ansible.builtin.package).
        support: partial
    async:
        support: none
    bypass_host_loop:
        support: none

    diff_mode:
        support: full
    platform:
        platforms: rhel
notes:
  - When used with a C(loop:) each package will be processed individually, it is much more efficient to pass the list directly to the O(name) option.
  - Group removal doesn't work if the group was installed with Ansible because
    upstream dnf's API doesn't properly mark groups as installed, therefore upon
    removal the module is unable to detect that the group is installed
    U(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1620324).
  - While O(use_backend=yum) and the ability to call the action plugin as
    M(ansible.builtin.yum) are provided for syntax compatibility, the YUM
    backend was removed in ansible-core 2.17 because the required libraries are
    not available for any supported version of Python. If you rely on this
    functionality, use an older version of Ansible.
