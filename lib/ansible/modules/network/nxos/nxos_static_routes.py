module: nxos_static_routes
version_added: "2.10"
short_description: Configures and manages attributes of static routes on Cisco NX-OS platforms.
description: This module configures and manages the attributes of static routes on Cisco NX-OS platforms.
author: Adharsh Srivats Rangarajan (@adharshsrivatsr)
notes:
  - Tested against NX-OS 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
  - To parse configuration text, provide the output of show running-config | section interface  or a mocked up config
  - When a route is configured for a non-existent VRF, the VRF is created and the route is added to it.
  - When deleting routes for a VRF, all routes inside the VRF are deleted, but the VRF is not deleted.
