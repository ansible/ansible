        desirable to have the task get the current running-config for
        every task in a playbook.  The I(running_config) argument allows the
        implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base
        config for comparison. This value of this option should be the

      - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config) option to platform
        specific CLI commands which will be returned in the I(rendered) key within the result.
        For state I(rendered) active connection to remote host is not required.
      - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device and transform
        it into structured data in the format as per the resource module argspec and the
        value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and transforms
        it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters and the value is returned in
        the I(parsed) key within the result. The value of C(running_config) option should be the
        same format as the output of command I(show running-config | include ip route|ipv6 route)
        executed on device. For state I(parsed) active connection to remote host is not required.
