module: exos_command
version_added: "2.6"
author: "Rafael D. Vencioneck (@rdvencioneck)"
short_description: Run commands on remote devices running Extreme EXOS
description:
  - Sends arbitrary commands to an Extreme EXOS device and returns the results
    read from the device. This module includes an argument that will cause the
    module to wait for a specific condition before returning or timing out if
    the condition is not met.
  - This module does not support running configuration commands.
    We expect to release an exos_config module soon to configure EXOS devices.
notes:
  - If a command sent to the device requires answering a prompt, it is possible
    to pass a dict containing I(command), I(answer) and I(prompt). See examples.
options:
  commands:
    description:
      - List of commands to send to the remote EXOS device over the
        configured provider. The resulting output from the command
        is returned. If the I(wait_for) argument is provided, the
        module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or
        the number of retries has expired.
    required: true
  wait_for:
    description:
      - List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the
        command. The task will wait for each condition to be true
        before moving forward. If the conditional is not true
        within the configured number of retries, the task fails.
        See examples.
    default: null
  match:
    description:
      - The I(match) argument is used in conjunction with the
        I(wait_for) argument to specify the match policy.  Valid
        values are C(all) or C(any).  If the value is set to C(all)
        then all conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied.  If
        the value is set to C(any) then only one of the values must be
        satisfied.
    default: all
    choices: ['any', 'all']
  retries:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried
        before it is considered failed. The command is run on the
        target device every retry and evaluated against the
        I(wait_for) conditions.
    default: 10
  interval:
    description:
      - Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries
        of the command. If the command does not pass the specified
        conditions, the interval indicates how long to wait before
        trying the command again.
    default: 1
