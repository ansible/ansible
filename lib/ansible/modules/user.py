            - Lock the password (C(usermod -L), C(usermod -U), C(pw lock)).
            - Implementation differs by platform. This option does not always mean the user cannot login using other methods.
            - This option does not disable the user, only lock the password.
            - This must be set to C(False) in order to unlock a currently locked password. The absence of this parameter will not unlock a password.
            - Currently supported on Linux, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD.

    local:
        description:
            - Forces the use of "local" command alternatives on platforms that implement it.
            - This is useful in environments that use centralized authentication when you want to manipulate the local users
              (in other words, it uses C(luseradd) instead of C(useradd)).
            - This will check C(/etc/passwd) for an existing account before invoking commands. If the local account database
              exists somewhere other than C(/etc/passwd), this setting will not work properly.
            - This requires that the above commands as well as C(/etc/passwd) must exist on the target host, otherwise it will be a fatal error.
        type: bool
        default: no
        version_added: "2.4"

        version_added: "2.8"
    authorization:

            - Does nothing when used with other platforms.
            - Can set multiple roles using comma separation.

            - Sets the umask of the user.
            - Does nothing when used with other platforms.
            - Currently supported on Linux.
            - Requires C(local) is omitted or False.

    platform:
        platforms: posix
notes:
  - There are specific requirements per platform on user management utilities. However
    they generally come pre-installed with the system and Ansible will require they
    are present at runtime. If they are not, a descriptive error message will be shown.
  - On SunOS platforms, the shadow file is backed up automatically since this module edits it directly.
    On other platforms, the shadow file is backed up by the underlying tools used by this module.
  - On macOS, this module uses C(dscl) to create, modify, and delete accounts. C(dseditgroup) is used to
    modify group membership. Accounts are hidden from the login window by modifying
    C(/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist).
  - On FreeBSD, this module uses C(pw useradd) and C(chpass) to create, C(pw usermod) and C(chpass) to modify,
    C(pw userdel) remove, C(pw lock) to lock, and C(pw unlock) to unlock accounts.
  - On all other platforms, this module uses C(useradd) to create, C(usermod) to modify, and
    C(userdel) to remove accounts.
