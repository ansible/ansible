module: gcp_compute_disk
description:
    - Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to the physical
      disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the hardware behind these
      devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize performance for you. Persistent disks
      are available as either standard hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).
    - Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine instances,
      so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data even after you delete
      your instances. Persistent disk performance scales automatically with size, so you
      can resize your existing persistent disks or add more persistent disks to an instance
      to meet your performance and storage space requirements.
    - Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and affordable storage
      with consistent performance characteristics.
