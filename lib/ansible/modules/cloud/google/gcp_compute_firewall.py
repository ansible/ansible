module: gcp_compute_firewall
description:
- Each network has its own firewall controlling access to and from the instances.
- All traffic to instances, even from other instances, is blocked by the firewall
  unless firewall rules are created to allow it.
- The default network has automatically created firewall rules that are shown in default
  firewall rules. No manually created network has automatically created firewall rules
  except for a default "allow" rule for outgoing traffic and a default "deny" for
  incoming traffic. For all networks except the default network, you must create any
  firewall rules you need.
