                - The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.
                - Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing scheme (EXTERNAL
                  or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).
                - When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the address
                  must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the address must live in
                  the same region as the forwarding rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4
                  address from the same scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding
                  rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4 or IPv6.
                - When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP address
                  belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding rule. By default,
                  if this field is empty, an ephemeral internal IP address will be automatically allocated
                  from the IP range of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.
