module: gcp_container_node_pool
description:
    - NodePool contains the name and configuration for a cluster's node pool.
    - Node pools are a set of nodes (i.e. VM's), with a common configuration and specification,
      under the control of the cluster master. They may have a set of Kubernetes labels
      applied to them, which may be used to reference them during pod scheduling. They
      may also be resized up or down, to accommodate the workload.
