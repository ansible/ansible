module: gcp_compute_global_forwarding_rule
description:
    - Represents a GlobalForwardingRule resource. Global forwarding rules are used to
      forward traffic to the correct load balancer for HTTP load balancing. Global forwarding
      rules can only be used for HTTP load balancing.
    - For more information, see U(https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/)
      .
short_description: Creates a GCP GlobalForwardingRule
version_added: 2.6

              or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).
            - When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the address
              must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the address must live in
              the same region as the forwarding rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4
              address from the same scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding
              rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4 or IPv6.
            - When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP address
              belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding rule. By default,
              if this field is empty, an ephemeral internal IP address will be automatically allocated
              from the IP range of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.
