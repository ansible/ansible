        type: str
      attributes:
        description:
        - Endpoint configuration attributes.
        - Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can be used to
          control different aspects of the message delivery.
        - The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you can use to
          change the format of the pushed message. This attribute indicates the version
          of the data expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed
          message (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is based on
          the version of the Pub/Sub API.
        - If not present during the subscriptions.create call, it will default to
          the version of the API used to make such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
          call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get calls will always
          return a valid version, even if the subscription was created without this
          attribute.
        - 'The possible values for this attribute are: - v1beta1: uses the push format
          defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.'
        - "- v1 or v1beta2: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API."
        required: false
        type: dict
  ack_deadline_seconds:
    description:
    - This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message before
      the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message delivery but before
      the ack deadline expires and before the message is acknowledged, it is an outstanding
      message and will not be delivered again during that time (on a best-effort basis).
    - For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack
      deadline. To override this value for a given message, call subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline
      with the corresponding ackId if using pull. The minimum custom deadline you
      can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600
      seconds (10 minutes).
    - If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.
    - For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the
      call to the push endpoint.
    - If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually
      redeliver the message.
    required: false
    type: int
  message_retention_duration:
    description:
    - How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's backlog, from
      the moment a message is published. If retainAckedMessages is true, then this
      also configures the retention of acknowledged messages, and thus configures
      how far back in time a subscriptions.seek can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot
      be more than 7 days (`"604800s"`) or less than 10 minutes (`"600s"`).
    - 'A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by ''s''.
      Example: `"600.5s"`.'
    required: false
    default: 604800s
    type: str
    version_added: '2.8'
  retain_acked_messages:
    description:
    - Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If `true`, then messages
      are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if they are acknowledged,
      until they fall out of the messageRetentionDuration window.
    required: false
    type: bool
    version_added: '2.8'
  expiration_policy:
    description:
    - A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration.
    - A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber is successfully
      consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing operations on the subscription.
      If expirationPolicy is not set, a default policy with ttl of 31 days will be
      used. If it is set but ttl is "", the resource never expires. The minimum allowed
      value for expirationPolicy.ttl is 1 day.

        - If ttl is not set, the associated resource never expires.
        - A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'.

  env_type:
    description:
    - Specifies which Ansible environment you're running this module within.
    - This should not be set unless you know what you're doing.
    - This only alters the User Agent string for any API requests.
    type: str
notes:
- 'API Reference: U(https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.subscriptions)'
- 'Managing Subscriptions: U(https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#managing_subscriptions)'
- for authentication, you can set service_account_file using the C(gcp_service_account_file)
  env variable.
- for authentication, you can set service_account_contents using the C(GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS)
  env variable.
- For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the C(GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL)
  env variable.
- For authentication, you can set auth_kind using the C(GCP_AUTH_KIND) env variable.
- For authentication, you can set scopes using the C(GCP_SCOPES) env variable.
- Environment variables values will only be used if the playbook values are not set.
- The I(service_account_email) and I(service_account_file) options are mutually exclusive.
