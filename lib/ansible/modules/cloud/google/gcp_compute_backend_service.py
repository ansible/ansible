module: gcp_compute_backend_service
description:
- A Backend Service defines a group of virtual machines that will serve traffic for
  load balancing. This resource is a global backend service, appropriate for external
  load balancing or self-managed internal load balancing.
- For managed internal load balancing, use a regional backend service instead.
- Currently self-managed internal load balancing is only available in beta.
