module: gcp_compute_image
description:
- Represents an Image resource.
- Google Compute Engine uses operating system images to create the root persistent
  disks for your instances. You specify an image when you create an instance. Images
  contain a boot loader, an operating system, and a root file system. Linux operating
  system images are also capable of running containers on Compute Engine.
- Images can be either public or custom.
- Public images are provided and maintained by Google, open-source communities, and
  third-party vendors. By default, all projects have access to these images and can
  use them to create instances. Custom images are available only to your project.
  You can create a custom image from root persistent disks and other images. Then,
  use the custom image to create an instance.

      enable VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE on images with driver version 1.2.0.1621 or higher.
      Linux images with kernel versions 3.17 and higher will support VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE.
