  env variable.
- For authentication, you can set service_account_email using the C(GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL)

    IPAddress:
      description:
      - The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.
      - Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing scheme
        (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).
      - When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the
        address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the address
        must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. If this field is empty,
        an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same scope (global or regional) will be
        assigned. A regional forwarding rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding
        rule supports either IPv4 or IPv6.
      - When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP
        address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding rule.
        By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral internal IP address will
        be automatically allocated from the IP range of the subnet or network configured
        for this forwarding rule.
      - 'An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a URL reference
        to an existing Address resource. The following examples are all valid: * 100.1.2.3

        only TCP is valid.
      returned: success
      type: str
    ipVersion:

      - 'The value of INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED means that this will be used for Internal
        Global HTTP(S) LB. The value of EXTERNAL means that this will be used for
        External Global Load Balancing (HTTP(S) LB, External TCP/UDP LB, SSL Proxy)
        NOTE: Currently global forwarding rules cannot be used for INTERNAL load balancing.'

    metadataFilters:
      description:
      - Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing configuration
        to a limited set xDS compliant clients. In their xDS requests to Loadbalancer,
        xDS clients present node metadata. If a match takes place, the relevant routing
        configuration is made available to those proxies.
      - For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to
        MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding label
        provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL,
        then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels in the provided
        metadata.
      - metadataFilters specified here can be overridden by those specified in the
        UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references.
      - metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme
        set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

              type: str
    name:
      description:
      - Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
        The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically,
        the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
        which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following

        which cannot be a dash.

      description:
      - This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy, TargetHttpsProxy,
        TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway, TargetPool, TargetInstance.
      - Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets addressed
        to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
      - Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint
        port ranges.
