              using the builder service account's credentials if necessary.
            - The Docker daemon's cache will already have the latest versions of all
              of the officially supported build steps (U(https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders)).
            - The Docker daemon will also have cached many of the layers for some
              popular images, like "ubuntu", "debian", but they will be refreshed
              at the time you attempt to use them.
            - If you built an image in a previous build step, it will be stored in

              directory. If this value is absolute, it may be outside the build's
              working directory, in which case the contents of the path may not be
              persisted across build step executions, unless a `volume` for that path
              is specified.
            - If the build specifies a `RepoSource` with `dir` and a step with a `dir`,
              which specifies an absolute path, the `RepoSource` `dir` is ignored

              build step. Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents
              are discarded.
            - Using a named volume in only one step is not valid as it is indicative
              of a build request with an incorrect configuration.
