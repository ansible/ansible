    - A ForwardingRule resource. A ForwardingRule resource specifies which pool of target
      virtual machines to forward a packet to if it matches the given [IPAddress, IPProtocol,
      portRange] tuple.
short_description: Creates a GCP ForwardingRule
version_added: 2.6

            - When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the address
              must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the address must live in
              the same region as the forwarding rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4
              address from the same scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding
              rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4 or IPv6.
            - When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP address
              belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding rule. By default,
              if this field is empty, an ephemeral internal IP address will be automatically allocated
