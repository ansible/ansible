module: gcp_compute_forwarding_rule
description:
- A ForwardingRule resource. A ForwardingRule resource specifies which pool of target
  virtual machines to forward a packet to if it matches the given [IPAddress, IPProtocol,
  portRange] tuple.
short_description: Creates a GCP ForwardingRule
version_added: 2.6
author: Google Inc. (@googlecloudplatform)
requirements:
- python >= 2.6
- requests >= 2.18.4
- google-auth >= 1.3.0
options:

    - Whether the given object should exist in GCP
    choices:
    - present

    default: present
  description:
    description:
    - An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create
      the resource.
    required: false
  ip_address:
    description:
    - The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.
    - Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing scheme
      (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).
    - When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the
      address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the address
      must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. If this field is empty,
      an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same scope (global or regional) will be assigned.
      A regional forwarding rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports
      either IPv4 or IPv6.
    - When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP
      address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding rule.
      By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral internal IP address will be
      automatically allocated from the IP range of the subnet or network configured
      for this forwarding rule.
    - 'An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a URL reference
      to an existing Address resource. The following examples are all valid: * 100.1.2.3
      * U(https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region/addresses/address)

  ip_protocol:
    description:
    - The IP protocol to which this rule applies. Valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP,
      AH, SCTP or ICMP.
    - When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only TCP and UDP are valid.
    - 'Some valid choices include: "TCP", "UDP", "ESP", "AH", "SCTP", "ICMP"'
    required: false
  backend_service:
    description:
    - A BackendService to receive the matched traffic. This is used only for INTERNAL
      load balancing.
    - 'This field represents a link to a BackendService resource in GCP. It can be
      specified in two ways. First, you can place a dictionary with key ''selfLink''
      and value of your resource''s selfLink Alternatively, you can add `register:
      name-of-resource` to a gcp_compute_backend_service task and then set this backend_service

  name:
    description:
    - Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The
      name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the
      name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
      which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character,
      which cannot be a dash.
    required: true
  network:
    description:

      balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If this field is not

      to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
    - Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint
      port ranges.
