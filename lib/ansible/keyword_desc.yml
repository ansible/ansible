accelerate: "*DEPRECATED*, set to True to use accelerate connection plugin."
accelerate_ipv6: "*DEPRECATED*, set to True to force accelerate plugin to use ipv6 for its connection."
accelerate_port: "*DEPRECATED*, set to override default port use for accelerate connection."
action: "The 'action' to execute for a task, it normally translates into a C(module) or action plugin."
args: "A secondary way to add arguments into a task. Takes a dictionary in which keys map to options and values."
always: List of tasks, in a block, that execute no matter if there is an error in the block or not.
any_errors_fatal: Force any un-handled task errors on any host to propagate to all hosts and end the play.
async: Run a task asynchronously if the C(action) supports this; the value is the maximum runtime in seconds.
become: Boolean that controls if privilege escalation is used or not on :term:`Task` execution. Implemented by the become plugin. See :ref:`become_plugins`.
become_exe: Path to the executable used to elevate privileges. Implemented by the become plugin. See :ref:`become_plugins`.
become_flags: A string of flag(s) to pass to the privilege escalation program when :term:`become` is True.
become_method: Which method of privilege escalation to use (such as sudo or su).
become_user: "User that you 'become' after using privilege escalation. The remote/login user must have permissions to become this user."
block: List of tasks in a block.
changed_when: "Conditional expression that overrides the task's normal 'changed' status."
check_mode: A boolean that controls if a task is executed in 'check' mode. See :ref:`check_mode_dry`.
collections: |
    List of collection namespaces to search for modules, plugins, and roles. See :ref:`collections_using_playbook`

    .. note::

        Tasks within a role do not inherit the value of ``collections`` from the play. To have a role search a list of collections, use the ``collections`` keyword in ``meta/main.yml`` within a role.


connection: Allows you to change the connection plugin used for tasks to execute on the target. See :ref:`using_connection`.
debugger: Enable debugging tasks based on the state of the task result. See :ref:`playbook_debugger`.
delay: Number of seconds to delay between retries. This setting is only used in combination with :term:`until`.
delegate_facts: Boolean that allows you to apply facts to a delegated host instead of inventory_hostname.
delegate_to: Host to execute task instead of the target (inventory_hostname). Connection vars from the delegated host will also be used for the task.
diff: "Toggle to make tasks return 'diff' information or not."
environment: A dictionary that gets converted into environment vars to be provided for the task upon execution. This can ONLY be used with modules. This is not supported for any other type of plugins nor Ansible itself nor its configuration, it just sets the variables for the code responsible for executing the task. This is not a recommended way to pass in confidential data.
fact_path: Set the fact path option for the fact gathering plugin controlled by :term:`gather_facts`.
failed_when: "Conditional expression that overrides the task's normal 'failed' status."
force_handlers: Will force notified handler execution for hosts even if they failed during the play. Will not trigger if the play itself fails.
gather_facts: "A boolean that controls if the play will automatically run the 'setup' task to gather facts for the hosts."
gather_subset: Allows you to pass subset options to the fact gathering plugin controlled by :term:`gather_facts`.
gather_timeout: Allows you to set the timeout for the fact gathering plugin controlled by :term:`gather_facts`.
handlers: "A section with tasks that are treated as handlers, these won't get executed normally, only when notified after each section of tasks is complete. A handler's `listen` field is not templatable."
hosts: "A list of groups, hosts or host pattern that translates into a list of hosts that are the play's target."
ignore_errors: Boolean that allows you to ignore task failures and continue with play. It does not affect connection errors.
ignore_unreachable: Boolean that allows you to ignore task failures due to an unreachable host and continue with the play. This does not affect other task errors (see :term:`ignore_errors`) but is useful for groups of volatile/ephemeral hosts.
loop: "Takes a list for the task to iterate over, saving each list element into the ``item`` variable (configurable via loop_control)"
loop_control: Several keys here allow you to modify/set loop behavior in a task. See :ref:`loop_control`.
max_fail_percentage: can be used to abort the run after a given percentage of hosts in the current batch has failed. This only works on linear or linear-derived strategies.
module_env: A dictionary that gets converted into environment vars to be provided for the task's module execution. Unlike `environment` this will not affect shell or privilege escalation and is only available to subprocesses of the module itself.
module_defaults: Specifies default parameter values for modules.
name: "Identifier. Can be used for documentation, or in tasks/handlers."
no_log: Boolean that controls information disclosure.
notify: "List of handlers to notify when the task returns a 'changed=True' status."
order: Controls the sorting of hosts as they are used for executing the play. Possible values are inventory (default), sorted, reverse_sorted, reverse_inventory and shuffle.
poll: Sets the polling interval in seconds for async tasks (default 10s).
port: Used to override the default port used in a connection.
post_tasks: A list of tasks to execute after the :term:`tasks` section.
pre_tasks: A list of tasks to execute before :term:`roles`.
remote_user: User used to log into the target via the connection plugin.
register: Name of variable that will contain task status and module return data.
rescue: List of tasks in a :term:`block` that run if there is a task error in the main :term:`block` list.
retries: "Number of retries before giving up in a :term:`until` loop. This setting is only used in combination with :term:`until`."
roles: List of roles to be imported into the play
run_once: Boolean that will bypass the host loop, forcing the task to attempt to execute on the first host available and afterward apply any results and facts to all active hosts in the same batch.
serial: Explicitly define how Ansible batches the execution of the current play on the play's target. See :ref:`rolling_update_batch_size`.
strategy: Allows you to choose the strategy plugin to use for the play. See :ref:`strategy_plugins`.
tags: Tags applied to the task or included tasks, this allows selecting subsets of tasks from the command line.
tasks: Main list of tasks to execute in the play, they run after :term:`roles` and before :term:`post_tasks`.
timeout: Time limit for the task action to execute in, if exceeded, Ansible will interrupt the process. Timeout does not include templating or looping.
throttle: Limit the number of concurrent task runs on task, block and playbook level. This is independent of the forks and serial settings, but cannot be set higher than those limits. For example, if forks is set to 10 and the throttle is set to 15, at most 10 hosts will be operated on in parallel.
until: "This keyword implies a ':term:`retries` loop' that will go on until the condition supplied here is met or we hit the :term:`retries` limit."
vars: Dictionary/map of variables
vars_files: List of files that contain vars to include in the play.
vars_prompt: list of variables to prompt for.
when: Conditional expression, determines if an iteration of a task is run or not.
