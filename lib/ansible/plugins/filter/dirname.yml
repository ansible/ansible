  short_description: get a path's directory name
  description:
    - Returns the 'head' component of a path, basically everything that is not the 'basename'.
  notes:
    - The result of this filter is different from the Unix dirname program; where dirname for C(/foo/bar/) returns C(/foo), the dirname filter returns the full path (C(/foo/bar/)).
  options:
    _input:
      description: A path.
      type: path
      required: true

  # To get the dir name of a file path, like '/etc/asdf' out of '/etc/asdf/foo.txt'.
  {{ mypath | dirname }}

RETURN:
  _value:
    description: The directory portion of the original path.
    type: path
