  short_description: get a path's base name
  description:
    - Returns the last name component of a path, what is left in the string that is not 'dirname'.
  notes:
    - The result of this filter is different from the Unix basename program; where basename for C(/foo/bar/) returns C(bar), the basename filter returns an empty string (C('')).
  options:
    _input:
      description: A path.
      type: path
      required: true

  {{ mypath | basename }}

    description: The base name from the path provided.
