    name: host_group_vars
    version_added: "2.4"
    short_description: In charge of loading group_vars and host_vars
    requirements:
        - whitelist in configuration
    description:
        - Loads YAML vars into corresponding groups/hosts in group_vars/ and host_vars/ directories.
        - Files are restricted by extension to one of .yaml, .json, .yml or no extension.
        - Hidden (starting with '.') and backup (ending with '~') files and directories are ignored.
        - Only applies to inventory sources that are existing paths.
        - Starting in 2.10, this plugin requires whitelisting and is whitelisted by default.

      stage:
        ini:
          - key: stage

        description:
          - "Check all of these extensions when looking for 'variable' files which should be YAML or JSON or vaulted versions of these."
          - 'This affects vars_files, include_vars, inventory and vars plugins among others.'
