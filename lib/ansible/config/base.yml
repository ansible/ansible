    merge: Any dictionary variable will be recursively merged with new definitions across the different variable definition sources.
  description:
    - This setting controls how duplicate definitions of dictionary variables (aka hash, map, associative array) are handled in Ansible.
    - This does not affect variables whose values are scalars (integers, strings) or arrays.
    - "**WARNING**, changing this setting is not recommended as this is fragile and makes your content (plays, roles, collections) non portable,
      leading to continual confusion and misuse. Don't change this setting unless you think you have an absolute need for it."
    - We recommend avoiding reusing variable names and relying on the ``combine`` filter and ``vars`` and ``varnames`` lookups
      to create merged versions of the individual variables. In our experience this is rarely really needed and a sign that too much
      complexity has been introduced into the data structures and plays.
    - For some uses you can also look into custom vars_plugins to merge on input, even substituting the default ``host_group_vars``
      that is in charge of parsing the ``host_vars/`` and ``group_vars/`` directories. Most users of this setting are only interested in inventory scope,
      but the setting itself affects all sources and makes debugging even harder.
    - All playbooks and roles in the official examples repos assume the default for this setting.
    - Changing the setting to ``merge`` applies across variable sources, but many sources will internally still overwrite the variables.
      For example ``include_vars`` will dedupe variables internally before updating Ansible, with 'last defined' overwriting previous definitions in same file.
    - The Ansible project recommends you **avoid ``merge`` for new projects.**
    - It is the intention of the Ansible developers to eventually deprecate and remove this setting, but it is being kept as some users do heavily rely on it.
      New projects should **avoid 'merge'**.

    fallback behavior will issue a warning that the interpreter should be set explicitly (since interpreters installed
    later may change which one is used). This warning behavior can be disabled by setting ``auto_silent``. The default
    value of ``auto_legacy`` provides all the same behavior, but for backwards-compatibility with older Ansible releases
    that always defaulted to ``/usr/bin/python``, will use that interpreter if present (and issue a warning that the
    default behavior will change to that of ``auto`` in a future Ansible release.

WIN_ASYNC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT:

  default: 5
  description:
    - For asynchronous tasks in Ansible (covered in Asynchronous Actions and Polling),
      this is how long, in seconds, to wait for the task spawned by Ansible to connect back to the named pipe used
      on Windows systems. The default is 5 seconds. This can be too low on slower systems, or systems under heavy load.
    - This is not the total time an async command can run for, but is a separate timeout to wait for an async command to
      start. The task will only start to be timed against its async_timeout once it has connected to the pipe, so the
      overall maximum duration the task can take will be extended by the amount specified here.
