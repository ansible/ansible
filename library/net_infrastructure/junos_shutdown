module: junos_shutdown
author: Jeremy Schulman, Juniper Networks
version_added: "1.7"
short_description: Shut down or reboot a device running Junos OS.
description:
    - Shut down (power off) or reboot a device running Junos OS. This includes
      all Routing Engines in a Virtual Chassis or a dual Routing Engine system.
      This is equivalent to executing either the Junos OS B(request system power-off)
      or B(request system reboot) operational command.
requirements:
    - junos-eznc >= 1.0.0
options:
    host:
        description:
            - Set to {{ inventory_hostname }}
        required: true
    user:
        description:
            - Login username
        required: false
        default: $USER
    passwd:
        description:
            - Login password
        required: false
        default: assumes ssh-key active
    reboot:
        description:
            - If set to B(yes), then the device is rebooted rather than powered off.
        required: false
        default: no
        choices: ['yes','no']
    shutdown:
        description:
            - Safety mechanism. You B(MUST) set this to 'shutdown'.
        required: yes
        default: None
