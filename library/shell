version_added: "0.0.2"
options:
  (free form):
    description:
      - The command module takes a free form command to run
    required: null
    default: null
  creates:
    description:
      - a filename, when it already exists, this step will NOT be run
    required: false
    default: null
  chdir:
    description:

    required: false
    default: null
examples:
   - code: shell somescript.sh >> somelog.txt
     description: Execute the command in remote shell
notes:
   -  If you want to execute a command securely and predicably, it may be better to use the 'command' module instead. Best practices when writing playbooks will follow the trend of using M(command) unless M(shell) is explicitly required. When running ad-hoc commands, use your best judgement.
